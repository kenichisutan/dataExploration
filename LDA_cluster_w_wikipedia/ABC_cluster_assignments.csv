"The sprawling European science lab that houses the world’s largest atom smasher is taking new steps that will further limit its cooperation with Russian research institutes GENEVA -- The sprawling European science lab that houses the world’s largest atom smasher is taking new steps that will further limit its cooperation with Russian research institutes in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The CERN Council, the governing body of the Geneva-based lab with 23 member states, announced Friday that its scientists will suspend participation in all scientific committees in Russia and neighboring Belarus, a Russian ally that facilitated the Feb. 24 invasion. CERN, the historic acronym for what is now the European Organization for Nuclear Research, had grappled with its response to the invasion because nearly 7% of its 18,000-odd researchers from around the world are linked to Russian institutions. On March 8, the council suspended new collaborations with Russia and stripped Russia of its observer status at the organization. The issue of whether to further sanction Russia became pressing because the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator, is set to start its third-ever run next month. The machine propels particles through an underground, 27-kilometer (17-mile) ring of superconducting magnets in and around Geneva, generating science that can help elucidate mysteries like dark matter or the standard model of particle physics. Russian scientists have been involved in planning multiple experiments. Under the new measures approved Friday, CERN will suspend all joint events with Russian institutes and pause considering any new candidates from Russia and Belarus to join the organization's staff. The council also announced that it will suspend all collaboration with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, an international grouping of 19 member nations based in Dubna, Russia. More than half of the members are former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, but they also include Cuba, the Czech Republic, Poland, North Korea, and Vietnam.",6
"Pfizer, Apple, Pepsi and Starbucks are just a few. Russia’s debt situation explained by Deirdre Bolton Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has led some of the biggest companies in the world to change their business relationships with Russia.

"Officials say a portion of a downtown Boston parking garage that was being demolished has collapsed, killing a construction worker BOSTON -- A portion of a downtown Boston parking garage that was being demolished collapsed Saturday evening, killing a construction worker, officials said. Boston Emergency Medical Services confirmed one person was killed and a second person was transported to an area hospital, WCVB-TV reported. Part of the Government Center garage came down after a concrete slab on the ninth floor collapsed, construction firm John Moriarty & Associates said in a statement. Boston Fire Commissioner Jack Dempsey told reporters that a worker who was completing demolition work in a construction vehicle fell over the side of the garage when the structure collapsed, falling a significant height. The worker was found under a pile of rubble and pronounced dead at the scene by authorities, Dempsey said. “This is a horrible tragedy and my heart goes out to the family and loved ones of the worker,” said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. The body has not been immediately recovered because Dempsey said firefighters are waiting until the Boston Inspection Services department determines the area can be safely entered. “We're not going to put anybody in there until it's safe to do so,” Dempsey told reporters. Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden told WCVB-TV that the person who died was a young man, but he did not identify him. “Our heartfelt thoughts and condolences go out to the loved ones of the worker who lost his life,” John Moriarty & Associates said in a statement. “JMA remains committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all our employees and trade partners. We would like to thank the Boston Police Department and EMS for their swift response.”",9
"A Chinese Australian journalist who has been held in China since August 2020 will be tried next week, the Australian government said Saturday On Location: March 30, 2022 BEIJING -- A Chinese Australian journalist who has been held in China since August 2020 will be tried next week, the Australian government said Saturday. Cheng Lei, who was a prominent journalist for China's state-run international network CGTN, was initially detained and later formally arrested on suspicion of supplying state secrets overseas. The Chinese government has notified Australia that her trial will be held on Thursday, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement posted online. “We expect basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment to be met, in accordance with international norms,” the statement said. The National Press Clubs of the United States and Australia as well as the journalist’s former CGTN colleagues and friends wrote open letters last year calling for her immediate release. “Cheng Lei’s yearlong detention is an assault on journalism and on human rights,"" a U.S. National Press Club statement said. Australia has raised concern about Cheng's welfare and detention conditions. Payne's statement said that government officials last visited her on March 21. They have asked to be allowed to attend the trial. Cheng was born in China and graduated from the University of Queensland. Before becoming a journalist, she worked as an accountant and financial analyst in Australia for Cadbury Schweppes and ExxonMobil from 1995 to 2000, according to her CGTN profile. She moved to China in 2001 and joined state broadcaster CCTV the following year. She then was the China correspondent for CNBC Asia for nine years before returning to CCTV in 2012. She was the anchor of a business program on CGTN, the state broadcaster's international arm.",6
"Soaring energy and food prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are pushing some Middle Eastern and North African countries to the brink Ukraine takes back Russian-seized territory with counterattacks BEIRUT -- Layal Aswad was already exhausted by Lebanon’s devastating two-year economic collapse. Now, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sends food and energy prices soaring even further, she finds herself struggling to put food on the table for her family of four. “Even bread is not something we take for granted anymore,” said the 48-year-old housewife, standing recently in a supermarket aisle in front of gallons of cooking oil whose prices had risen to an all-time high. From Lebanon, Iraq and Syria to Sudan and Yemen, millions of people in the Middle East whose lives were already upended by conflict, displacement and poverty are now wondering where their next meals will come from. Ukraine and Russia account for a third of global wheat and barley exports, which countries in the Middle East rely on to feed millions of people who subsist on subsidized bread and bargain noodles. They are also top exporters of other grains and the sunflower seed oil that is used for cooking. Even before the war in Ukraine, people in countries across the Middle East and North Africa were not getting enough food to eat. Now with trade disruptions spurred by the conflict, more commodities are becoming either unaffordable or unavailable. “Put simply, people cannot afford food of the quality or quantity that they need, with those in conflict- and crisis-affected countries ... at greatest risk,” said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa Director at Human Rights Watch. A similar set of circumstances led to a series of uprisings starting in late 2010 known as the Arab Spring, when skyrocketing bread prices fueled anti-government protests across the Middle East, noted Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. “When prices jump, and poor people cannot feed their families, they will be on the streets,” Georgieva remarked Sunday at the Doha Forum, a policy conference in Qatar. In Iraq and Sudan, public frustration at food prices and a lack of government services erupted in street protests on several occasions over the past several weeks. “People have a right to food, and governments should do everything in their power to protect that right, otherwise we risk not only food insecurity but the insecurity and instability that gross deprivation on this scale could trigger,” Fakih said. The war also has sparked concern that much of the international aid upon which so many in the Arab world depend will be diverted to Ukraine, where more than 3.7 million people have fled the war, Europe’s largest exodus since World War II. “For the millions of Palestinians, Lebanese, Yemenis, Syrians, and others who live in countries experiencing conflict, catastrophic economic meltdowns, and increasing humanitarian needs, this would be equivalent to shutting down critical life support,” states an analysis released by Carnegie Middle East experts last week. In Syria, 14.6 million people will depend on assistance this year, 9% more than in 2021 and 32% more than in 2020, Joyce Msuya, the United Nations’ assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator, told the U.N. Security Council in February. In Yemen, basic needs are becoming even harder to meet for millions of impoverished people after seven years of war. A recent report by the U.N. and international aid groups estimated that more than 160,000 people in Yemen were likely to experience famine-like conditions in 2022. That number could climb much higher still because of the war in Ukraine. A U.N. appeal for the country earlier this month raised $1.3 billion, less than a third of what was sought. “I have nothing,” said Ghalib al-Najjar, a 48-year-old Yemeni father of seven whose family has lived in a refugee camp outside the rebel-held capital of Sanaa since fleeing fighting in their middle-class neighborhood more than four years ago. “I need flour, a package of flour. I need rice. I need sugar. I need what people need (to survive).” In Lebanon, which has been in the throes of economic collapse for the past two years, panic has set in among a population worn down by shortages of electricity, medicine and gasoline. The country’s main grain silos were destroyed by a massive explosion at a Beirut port in 2020. Now, with just six weeks of wheat reserves, many fear even darker days ahead. Several large supermarkets were out of flour and corn oil this week. “Whatever is put on shelves is being bought,” said Hani Bohsali, head of the food importers syndicate. He said 60% of the cooking oil consumed in Lebanon comes from Ukraine and the rest comes mostly from Russia. “This is not a small problem,” he said. Bohsali noted that a search is underway for alternative places from which to import needed products, but he said other countries have either banned food exports or significantly raised prices. Meanwhile, 5 liters (1 gallon) of cooking oil in Lebanon now costs around the same as the monthly minimum wage, which is still fixed at 675,000 Lebanese pounds, or $29, despite the currency having lost around 90% of its value since October 2019. Families, including Aswad’s, also are spending ever larger portions of their monthly income on neighborhood generators that light up their homes for most of the day in the absence of state-supplied electricity. Even those are threatening to shut down now, saying they can no longer afford to buy fuel on the market. “We are back to the Stone Age, stocking up on candles and things like toast and Picon (a processed cheese brand) in case we run out of everything,” Aswad said. In Syria, where more than 11 years of brutal war has left more than 90% of the country’s population living in poverty, products such as cooking oil — when they can be found — have doubled in price in the month since the war began in Ukraine. On a recent day at one government cooperative in the capital of Damascus, shelves were almost empty except for sugar and napkins. Egypt, the world’s top importer of wheat, is among the most vulnerable. Economic pressures, including rising inflation, are mounting in the country, where about a third of the population of more than 103 million lives below the poverty line, according to official figures. An Associated Press journalist who toured markets in three different middle-class neighborhoods in Cairo earlier this month found that the price of food staples such as bread — items that Egyptians refer to as “eish,” or life — have increased by up to 50%. Inflation is likely to swell further due to the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, typically a time of increased demand. Consumers have accused merchants of exploiting the war in Ukraine to raise prices even though they have not yet been affected. “They make profits from our pain,” lamented Doaa el-Sayed, an Egyptian elementary school teacher and mother of three. “I have to reduce the amount of everything I used to buy,” she said. In Libya, a country wracked by a yearslong civil war, the latest spike in the price of food staples has people worried that tough times are ahead. And in Gaza, prices that had already started to rise skyrocketed after the war in Ukraine erupted, adding an extra challenge to the 2 million residents of the impoverished Palestinian enclave who have endured years of blockade and conflict. Fayeq Abu Aker, a Gaza businessman, imports staples such as cooking oil, lentils, and pasta from a Turkish company. When the company canceled the cooking oil contract after the war began, Aker turned to Egypt. But despite the country’s proximity to Gaza, prices there were even higher. A box of four bottles of cooking oil now costs $26, double the price before the war. “In 40 years of my business, I have never seen a crisis like this,” he said. ——— Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue in Beirut; Sammy Magdy in Cairo; Wafaa Shurafa in Gaza City; and Rami Musa in Benghazi, Libya, contributed to this report.",9
"Donald Trump wants to use November’s midterm elections to solidify his continued dominance of the national Republican Party Trump plane makes emergency landing COMMERCE, Ga. -- In Donald Trump's push to fundamentally reshape the Republican Party, few places are a higher priority than Georgia. The former president has issued highly-coveted endorsements in races ranging from governor to state insurance commissioner. His backing of football legend Herschel Walker essentially cleared a path to the party's nomination for a critical U.S. Senate seat. Trump has taken a particularly active role in shaping the governor's race, recruiting former Sen. David Perdue to challenge incumbent Brian Kemp as retribution for Kemp not going along with lies about the 2020 election being stolen. And in an effort to clear a path for Perdue, Trump pressed another Republican in the race — Vernon Jones — to run for Congress instead. Trump returned to Georgia on Saturday night for a rally ahead of the state's May 24 primary to try to boost Perdue in a campaign that is emerging as an early, critical test of whether the former president can live up to his professed role as a kingmaker in the GOP. “Before we can defeat the Democrat socialists and communists ... we first have to defeat the RINO sellouts and the losers in the primaries this spring,” Trump told the crowd, lacing into Kemp again and again as he accused him of betraying Republican voters with the derisive acronym, “Republican in name only.” “Brian Kemp is a turncoat. He’s a coward and he’s a complete and total disaster,"" Trump went on, calling Perdue the only Republican who can defeat Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who is running for governor a second time. “Governor Kemp is focused on making sure Stacey Abrams is never our governor or the next president,"" Cody Hall, Kemp’s director of communications, said in response. But there are warning signs for Trump. While Walker is marching to the primary with minimal opposition, other races are more complicated. Jones, for instance, is now competing in a crowded congressional primary in which no one may clear the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. Perdue, meanwhile, may pose an even higher-profile challenge for the former president. He has struggled to raise money and, in a Fox News poll released this month, trailed Kemp 50% to 39%. If that dynamic holds, Kemp would be within striking distance of winning the primary outright, averting a runoff. “I think it could be the start of, I don’t want to use the word downfall, but it could be the start of his influence waning,” said Eric Tanenblatt, former chief of staff to ex-Georgia Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue and a former fundraiser for David Perdue who is backing Kemp in the primary. In remarks before Trump's arrival at the rally in Commerce in northeast Georgia, Perdue unveiled a series of sharper attacks on Kemp as he parroted Trump's election lies, declaring that “our elections in 2020 were absolutely stolen.” He accused Kemp of having “sold out” Georgia voters through a series of actions including refusing to call a special state legislative session before Jan. 6 to investigate or overturn the election. Kemp was required by state law to certify the results and has repeatedly said any other course would have invited endless litigation. No credible evidence has emerged to support Trump’s claims of mass voter fraud. Federal and state election officials and Trump’s own attorney general have said the election was fair, and the former president’s allegations were also roundly rejected by courts, including by judges Trump appointed. “By the way, where’s Brian Kemp? Where’s Brian?” Perdue asked. “He’s not here. You know why? Because he kicked sand in the face of the president the last two years and said ‘no’ every time the president asked for anything.” Perdue promised, if elected, to “make sure that those people responsible for that fraud in 2020 go to jail” as he escalated his rhetoric to mimic Trump's. Trump has been obsessed with this once Republican stronghold since the aftermath of the 2020 campaign, when he became the first GOP presidential candidate to lose the state in 28 years. It could again be central to his political future if he decides to run for the White House in 2024. That's why his activity in the state is especially notable as Trump is essentially rallying voters behind candidates who could go on to play critical roles in certifying future elections in which he's a participant. He's already shown an extraordinary willingness to press officials to overturn results he doesn't like. During his waning days in office, Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden’s victory, a conversation that is now the subject of a grand jury probe in Atlanta. The results in Georgia were certified after a trio of recounts, including one partially done by hand. They all affirmed Biden's victory. Given the former president's particular focus on Georgia, a stumble here could weaken his efforts elsewhere to champion candidates who have pledged loyalty to his vision of the GOP, which is dominated by election lies and culture clashes over issues related to race and gender. Some of those candidates are already struggling. Trump rescinded his endorsement of struggling Alabama Republican Senate primary candidate Mo Brooks on Wednesday. He will travel to North Carolina next month to try to boost his pick in North Carolina's contentious Senate primary, Republican U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, who has lagged in polling and fundraising behind former Gov. Pat McCrory. Trump's choice in Pennsylvania's Senate GOP primary dropped out, and Trump has so far not sided with a candidate in key but bruising party Senate primaries in Ohio and Missouri. Meanwhile, some top national Trump antagonists, including Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have not backed away from seeking reelection despite Trump promising for more than a year that he'd make sure they were defeated. Kemp, who is holding his own Saturday meeting with the Columbia County Republican Party in suburban Augusta, reported having $12.7 million in his main campaign account as of Jan. 31. That far outpaced Perdue, who had less than $1 million in cash on hand through January. The incumbent governor has vowed to provide an initial investment of at least $4.2 million on TV ads ahead of Georgia's primary. Other Trump detractors are stepping up spending, including GOP 2.0, a super PAC founded by Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who isn't seeking reelection but has been staunchly criticized by the former president for his defense of Georgia's 2020 election results. Duncan, a Republican, said Trump's endorsement isn't the “golden ticket” it once was, and his group is launching its first 30-second television spot timed to coincide with the former president's rally. In it, Duncan decries politicians “who would rather talk about conspiracy theories and past losses, letting liberal extremists take us in the wrong direction."" “You almost feel bad for David Perdue. That (he’s) walking off the plank that Donald Trump has put out there for him here in Georgia,” Duncan said in an interview. “We’re going to see a rally show up that’s once again going to confuse Georgians and who knows what Donald Trump’s gonna say,"" Duncan said. “He’s out to settle a score,"" Duncan added, referring to Trump, ""and that’s no way to keep conservative leadership in power.” Despite such concerns, Trump isn't backing down. Just this week, he threw his support behind the virtually unknown John Gordon to challenge Attorney General Chris Carr. He's also endorsed Patrick Witt to go up against Insurance Commissioner John King. The Republican incumbents are the statewide officials most closely aligned with Kemp, the leading target of Trump's ire. ——— Weissert reported from Washington.

"White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre says she has tested positive for COVID-19 after having returned from Europe with President Joe Biden White House press secretary has COVID WASHINGTON -- White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said she tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday after returning from Europe with President Joe Biden, in the latest infiltration of the coronavirus into the West Wing's protective bubble around Biden. Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy press secretary, said she last saw Biden “during a socially distanced meeting” on Saturday. Biden, because he is fully vaccinated, is not considered a “close contact"" under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Jean-Pierre traveled to Belgium and Poland with Biden after press secretary Jen Psaki tested positive for the virus last week. Biden returned to the White House early Sunday morning from the four-day trip that saw him work to bolster the NATO alliance after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Jean-Pierre said she was experiencing “mild symptoms,"" adding that “in alignment with White House COVID-19 protocols, I will work from home and plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of a five-day isolation period and a negative test.” The White House said Biden, 79, last tested negative for COVID-19 before returning to the U.S. from the trip as part of required pre-arrival testing.",3
"Will Smith's stunning slap of comic Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars instantly takes a prominent place on this list of stunning live television moments in entertainment NEW YORK -- Will Smith's Oscars slap wasn't the first time an unexpected moment on a live televised entertainment event left mouths agape. Here other notables: JANET JACKSON'S SUPER BOWL SHOW Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake were reaching the end of their “Rock Your Body” duet at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show when he yanked off her bustier, briefly revealing a bare breast with a sunburst nipple protector. The sheer scale of the event, with some 90 million people watching, made it a huge moment. Broadcaster CBS insisted it was as surprised as viewers at home, and it's still murky today whose idea it was. The phrases “wardrobe malfunction” and “nipplegate” joined the lexicon in its wake, a crackdown on television “indecency” was launched, and Jackson's career never fully recovered. KANYE INTERRUPTS TAYLOR SWIFT A 19-year-old Taylor Swift was thrilled to accept a “moon man” trophy at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when Kanye West stepped on her celebration. Appearing on the Radio City Music Hall stage, he took the microphone and said that while he was happy for Swift, “Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time.” He shrugged and handed the mic back to a clearly crestfallen Swift, left to stand alone as the crowd shrieked in shock. Bad blood between the music megastars lingered. OOPS! WRONG ENVELOPE When Warren Beatty opened the envelope supposedly containing the name of the best picture winner at the 2017 Oscars, he looked briefly confused before showing it to co-presenter Faye Dunaway, who anointed “La La Land” with the Oscar. Beatty's face was the hint something had gone awry: He'd been given the wrong envelope. After nearly 2 minutes of the wrong cast and producers celebrating onstage, the record was corrected. “Moonlight” had won. The accountants on duty that night lost — they were reassigned. SINEAD O'CONNOR'S RIP During rehearsals for her 1992 “Saturday Night Live” performance of the Bob Marley song, “War,” singer Sinead O'Connor had held up a picture of a child killed by police. But during the live show, she held a picture of Pope John Paul II that had hung on her mother's wall, and ripped it, to protest sexual abuse by priests. Condemnation was swift; even Frank Sinatra called her “one stupid broad.” Looking back years later, O'Connor wrote in a memoir, “I feel like having a No. 1 record derailed my career, and my tearing the photo put me back on the right track.” SOY BOMB Bob Dylan was in the midst of a career renaissance, invited to perform his song “Love Sick” at the Grammy Awards in 1998. As he sang, a shirtless man with the words “soy bomb” written on his torso appeared behind in a strangely contorting dance before being hustled off by security. Performance artist Michael Portnoy had been hired to stand in the background but, as he explained to the Hollywood Reporter later, “it was such a perfect format to do something inscrutable.” “AND THE NEW MISS UNIVERSE IS...” It was the climactic moment of the 2015 Miss Universe awards, and host Steve Harvey dramatically announced the winner, Miss Colombia. She stood on the stage for a few minutes and basked in the applause, waving the Colombian flag and blowing kisses. The crown was placed atop her head. Then Harvey sheepishly approached. “I have to apologize,” he said. She was actually the first runner-up. Miss Philippines was the winner. Harvey owned up to the mistake, which made for excruciating television. LET'S DO THE STREAK Streaking, or running naked in a public place, was a thing in 1974. Ray Stevens even had a hit song about it. So it couldn't have come as a complete surprise when a Los Angeles teacher, Robert Opel, stripped and rain onstage at that year's Oscars ceremony as actor David Niven talked. Opel had supposedly posed as a journalist to get in. There's been some suspicion that it was staged: Opel, who was murdered in a robbery attempt in 1979, appeared backstage later to talk about his stunt. Either way, Niven reacted with poise in quipping: “Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?”",6
"Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars provoked intense opinions online, especially from comedians who felt it was an assault on their art Will Smith has onstage confrontation with Chris Rock at Oscars NEW YORK -- Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars provoked intense opinions online, especially from comedians who felt it was an assault on their art. “Let me tell you something, it’s a very bad practice to walk up on stage and physically assault a comedian,” Kathy Griffin wrote on Twitter. “Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters. The violent exchange began when Rock took verbal aim at Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, saying, “Jada, I love you. ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it, all right?” Rock’s reference was made from the 1997 film “G.I. Jane,” starring Demi Moore, who shaved her head to portray a fictional Navy Seal candidate. Will Smith, her husband, walked onto the stage and took a swing at Rock with an open palm, generating a loud smack. Smith walked back to his seat and shouted for Rock to leave Pinkett Smith alone. Rock replied that he was just making a “G.I. Jane” joke — and Smith yelled back at him a second time. Smith shouted at Rock to “keep my wife’s name out of your (expletive) mouth,” and the crowd hushed as it became clear this was no act. Smith later won the best actor Oscar; Rock chose not to file a police report. “Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did. He’s lucky Chris is not filing assault charges,"" producer, director and actor Rob Reiner commented on Twitter. George Takei said Smith's losing his cool was a bad look when so many people were watching: “Many people, especially kids, look up to actors. Because of that, we have an obligation to try to be good role models. With celebrity comes responsibility.” Pinkett Smith revealed in 2018 that she was diagnosed with alopecia. She has often discussed the challenges of hair loss on Instagram and other social media platforms. Some commentators noted that alopecia is a painful experience that many Black women go through and should not be joked about. Rock himself helped create the documentary “Good Hair,” exploring African American women and their relationship to their hair. Nicki Minaj put herself in Pinkett Smith's shoes. “Imagine what it must feel like to be losing your hair to the point where you have to shave it bald. You think that’s easy to deal with for anyone? You don’t think she’s cried about that many times?” she wrote on Twitter. Many in the auditorium after the altercation came to support Smith, including Daniel Kaluuya, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. In the hours later, the hashtags #ProtectBlackWomen trended. ”Sometimes when you’re speaking about somebody’s wife, you can’t really help that. So that’s what I would say,” Mj Rodriguez told The AP at the Vanity Fair Oscar party. However unfunny Rock's joke was, it paled in comparison to some awards show digs in years past, including from acerbic Ricky Gervais, who has skewered the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Judi Dench and Felicity Huffman. Judd Apatow was highly critical of Smith in a now-deleted Twitter post, describing the attack “out of control rage and violence.” He noted that celebrities have been the target of jokes for decades: ""They’ve heard a million jokes about them in the last three decades. They are not freshman in the world of Hollywood and comedy. He lost his mind.” Richard Marx said no poor joke justified the response: “I guess millions of people can’t comprehend that no level of fame or accolades gives license to commit battery over a verbal joke.” And Mark Hamill called the incident the ugliest Oscar moment ever, tweeting “Stand-up comics are very adept at handling hecklers. Violent physical assault... not so much."" Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, wrote: “I know we’re all still processing, but the way casual violence was normalized tonight by a collective national audience will have consequences that we can’t even fathom in the moment.” But former late-night talk show host Conan O’Brien was among those making light of the situation, writing on Twitter: “Just saw the Will Smith slap.

"President Joe Biden is releasing a budget blueprint that tries to tell voters what the diverse and at times fractured Democratic Party stands for White House backtracks after Biden says Putin 'cannot remain in power' WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden announced a budget blueprint Monday that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, lower federal deficits, more money for police and greater funding for education, public health and housing. Appearing at the White House with his budget director Shalanda Young, Biden said the proposal sends a clear message to the public about “what we value.” He outlined a focus on fiscal responsibility, safety and security and investments to “build a better America.” The document essentially tries to tell voters what a diverse and at times fractured Democratic Party stands for ahead of the midterm elections that could decide whether Congress remains under the party's control. The bottom line: Biden is proposing a total of $5.8 trillion in federal spending in fiscal 2023, which begins in October, slightly less than what was projected to be spent this year before the supplemental spending bill was signed into law this month. The deficit would be $1.15 trillion. There would be $795 billion for defense, $915 billion for domestic programs, and the remaining balance would go to mandatory spending such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and net interest on the national debt. The higher taxes outlined on Monday would raise $361 billion in revenue over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households. The proposal lists another $1.4 trillion in revenue raised over the next decade through other tax increases that are meant to preserve Biden's pledge to not hike taxes on people earning less than $400,000. The 156-page plan also shows the splinters that persist in Biden's coalition and the possible gaps between the promises of what is being offered and the realities of what ultimately emerges. Biden has backed many of these ideas previously without necessarily getting a full buy-in from Congress. The proposal includes a minimum 20% tax on the incomes of households worth $100 million or more, similar to an earlier proposal Democrats in Congress began debating late last year in order to pay for Biden's domestic spending plans. But those spending plans were put on hold after talks with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin collapsed. More money would go to support law enforcement, yet bipartisan efforts at police reform have failed. The budget assumes — with a high degree of uncertainty based on forecasts made last November — that inflation at a 40-year peak gets back to normal next year. “Budgets are statements of values,” Biden said in a statement, “and the budget I am releasing today sends a clear message that we value fiscal responsibility, safety and security at home and around the world, and the investments needed to continue our equitable growth and build a better America.” It’s a midterm elections pitch to a nation still off balance from a chaotic few years caused by the pandemic, an economic recession, a recovery, challenges to U.S. democracy, and war in Ukraine. The Biden budget foresees cutting annual deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. Those reductions would occur in large part through higher taxes and the expiration of relief spending tied to the coronavirus outbreak that began in 2020. But like most presidential budgets, it's a proposal and a set of ideals rather than the law of the land. Congress is responsible for implementing the budget through tax and spending legislation and annual agency funding. The proposal faced immediate criticism from Republican lawmakers. They noted that deficits well in excess of $1 trillion annually would persist, said higher taxes could hurt growth and objected that additional government spending would feed into inflation. ""What this budget shows is that President Biden values more spending, more debt, more taxes and more pain for the American people,” said Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the top Republican on the House Budget Committee. On the tax front, it's unclear how Biden would get his polices through Congress. He had previously negotiated down the proposed 28% corporate tax rate, and his new minimum tax on the ultra wealthy would include “unrealized gains,"" which are potential profits that exist on paper because the underlying asset has yet to be sold. The result is that the special tax on people worth more than $100 million is unlikely to become law any time soon, said John Gimigliano, head of federal legislative & regulatory services at KPMG. “That is kind of like a slow burn proposal, like let’s continue to have this conversation over months or maybe years,"" Gimigliano said. While the budget would elevate funding for education, public health and provide $48 billion to increase the supply of affordable housing, it fails to spell out what the broader successor to Biden’s stalled “Build Back Better” agenda would be. That proposal from last year included money for child care, preschool, clean energy and lower health care premiums, but it was blocked by Manchin, the decisive Democratic vote. White House Budget Director Shalanda Young told reporters the blueprint does not include line items tied to that possible bill because “discussions with Congress are ongoing.” But the budget plan includes a “ deficit neutral reserve fund” to account for a possible agreement being reached. The Biden administration looked at a tax increase last year that resembles the 20% minimum on the full income of people worth $100 million or more. But Manchin nixed that idea as divisive. What the Biden administration outlined on Monday would raise $361 billion over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households. The proposal lists another $1.4 trillion in revenue raised over the next decade through other tax changes. Among the tax changes is a 28% corporate tax rate and top individual rate of 39.6%, both increases. Undergirding the plan is a forecast that the economy will return to normal next year after the unprecedented spending tied to the pandemic and inflation. The budget forecasts 4.7% inflation this year and 2.3% in 2023, which would be down from 7% in 2021. Yet prices kept climbing in the first two months of 2022, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed oil, gasoline and natural gas prices higher in ways that could spread across the economy. Cecilia Rouse, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the administration expects “the economy to normalize” as the country works through waves of the pandemic, supply chain pressures ease and the “extraordinary measures” of support tied to the coronavirus roll off the budget. That normalization would imply inflation falling back to its more typical levels, “but there’s tremendous uncertainty,” Rouse said.",8
"The judge said Trump's former lawyer John Eastman must turn over documents. Judge finds Trump 'likely' committed obstruction A federal judge has found that former President Donald Trump ""more likely than not"" committed felony obstruction in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. U.S District Judge David Carter said in the ruling that Trump's former lawyer John Eastman must turn over most documents he is withholding from the Jan. 6 House committee investigating the attack on the U.S Capitol. ""Based on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021,"" Carter wrote. The judge, who reviewed Eastman's documents, ordered Eastman to turn over all but ten that the court found privileged. In response, Eastman's legal team said in a statement Monday afternoon that Eastman ""intends to comply with the court's order"" and will turn over the requested documents. In his ruling, Judge Carter, a Clinton appointee, provided a summary of several documents Eastman has sought to block. ""The eleventh document is a chain forwarding to Dr. Eastman a draft memo written for President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani,"" Carter wrote. ""The memo recommended that Vice President Pence reject electors from contested states on January 6. This may have been the first time members of President Trump's team transformed a legal interpretation of the Electoral Count Act into a day-by-day plan of action."" ""The draft memo pushed a strategy that knowingly violated the Electoral Count Act, and Dr. Eastman's later memos closely track its analysis and proposal,"" Carter wrote. ""The memo is both intimately related to and clearly advanced the plan to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021,"" wrote the judge. ""Because the memo likely furthered the crimes of obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States, it is subject to the crime-fraud exception and the Court ORDERS it to be disclosed.""",2
"The House could refer the matter to the DOJ for possible criminal charges. Capitol insurrection: Tracking the attack 1 year later As it enters what lawmakers called a ""critical phase"" of its inquiry, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack recommended on Monday that the full chamber hold senior Trump White House officials in contempt of Congress for their refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas for records and testimony related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Ahead of the unanimous committee vote, the panel released a 34-page report on Sunday laying out congressional investigators' interest in Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, and how both Trump loyalists rebuffed requests for their cooperation, ahead of Monday night's vote on whether to refer the matter to the House. Both men ""stonewalled"" the committee, Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Monday. ""They're not fooling anybody. They are obligated to comply with our investigation. They have refused to do so. And that's a crime,"" he said. A successful House vote would send the referrals to the Justice Department, which would decide whether to pursue criminal charges. Each contempt charge could carry up to a $100,000 fine and up to one year in jail. ""The Select Committee’s witch hunt is predicated on the ridiculous legal premise that Joe Biden can waive Donald Trump’s Executive Privilege,"" Navarro said as part of a statement released after the vote. ""The Supreme Court will say otherwise when the time comes -- as it surely must -- and the DOJ knows such nonsense would gut Executive Privilege and the critical role it plays in effective presidential decision making."" ""The 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump just as surely as JFK stole it from Nixon in 1960,"" Navarro said. ""If that is true -- which I have found it to be -- the entire premise of the contempt charges filed against me fall to pieces."" The Justice Department has indicted Trump ally Steve Bannon for refusing to comply with the committee's subpoena. The trial for Bannon, who has pleaded not guilty, could begin this summer. The DOJ has not taken action on a referral from the House over former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' refusal to fully cooperate with the committee's subpoena -- something several committee members alluded to on Monday and appeared to criticize. ""The Department of Justice has a duty to act on this referral and others that we have sent,"" Rep. Adam Schiff said Monday. ""Without enforcement of Congressional subpoenas, there is no oversight, and without oversight, no accountability -- for the former President, or any other president, past, present, or future."" Navarro, who officially served as a trade adviser to then-President Donald Trump in the White House's West Wing, produced a report alleging that the presidential election was stolen from Trump -- which he said Trump distributed to all Republican members of Congress prior to Jan. 6. The committee wrote in its report that Navarro also worked closely with Trump ally Steve Bannon to delay Congress' certification of the election and to overturn the results, a plan Navarro dubbed the ""Green Bay Sweep"" in his book, ""In Trump Time."" According to the committee, Navarro spoke to Bannon on Jan. 6, encouraged Trump associates to contact Trump ally Roger Stone to discuss Jan. 6 plans, and encouraged hundreds of state legislators to ""take action"" ahead of the certification of the election results. Navarro has repeatedly rebuffed the committee and has refused to comply with its subpoena, arguing that Trump invoked executive privilege over their communications, even though he detailed parts of his work in his book -- and even though President Joe Biden, as the current commander-in-chief, declined to invoke privilege over his testimony. ""My position remains this is not my Executive Privilege to waive and the Committee should negotiate this matter with President Trump."" Navarro said in a statement Sunday, in response to the committee's report. ""If he waives the privilege, I will be happy to comply; but I see no effort by the Committee to clarify this matter with President Trump, which is bad faith and bad law."" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., on Monday called Navarro a ""key witness"" who had ""written a book boasting about his role in planning and coordinating the activity of Jan. 6, and yet he does not have the courage to testify here."" The Supreme Court previously rejected Trump's claims of privilege and refused to block the committee from some Trump White House records. The panel has also argued that Navarro's election-related work was not done in his capacity as a government official and would not be covered by executive privilege. ""We want to talk to Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro about their roles in an attempt to overturn an election. The American people didn't pay their salaries to do that,"" Thompson said, dismissing their claims of privilege. The committee wrote in its report that Scavino, a deputy chief of staff and longtime Trump aide, was ""uniquely positioned to illuminate"" Trump's knowledge and actions leading up to Jan. 6. Scavino also played a central part in amplifying Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud in his role managing the then-president's Twitter and other social media accounts. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., suggested Scavino ""could tell us"" what Trump was thinking on Jan. 6. ""We need to hear from him,"" he said on Monday. According to the committee's report, the panel has obtained evidence that Scavino spoke to Trump ""several times"" on Jan. 6 and was with him at the White House as he faced public and private calls to help stop the violence at the Capitol. Pointing to his online presence and links to Trump's following on social media, the committee said it had ""reason to believe"" that Scavino ""may have had advance warning of the possibility of violence on Jan. 6,"" given online activity on pro-Trump forums that suggested potential violence in Washington. ""Whether and when the President and other senior officials knew of impending violence is highly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation and consideration of legislative recommendations,"" the committee wrote. The panel issued three subpoenas to Scavino -- including one delivered by U.S. Marshals to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida -- and agreed to delay his deposition and document production deadline half a dozen times last year. Yet the committee said in its report that Scavino had ""not produced a single document, nor has he appeared for testimony."" Scavino also sued Verizon in January to stop the carrier from turning over his cell phone records to the committee. An attorney representing Scavino did not respond to requests for comment from ABC News.",6
"The conservative activist is the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Who is Virginia Thomas? The committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is expected to ask the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, for her cooperation following revelations of messages obtained by congressional investigators in which she repeatedly urged then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to sources familiar with committee members' deliberations. While the committee was debating asking Thomas for her voluntary cooperation, there are others on the panel who believe the committee should take the more aggressive step of attempting to compel her testimony via subpoena, the sources say. ""Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!"" Thomas wrote to Meadows on Nov. 10 after the election had been officially called for Joe Biden. ""You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History."" Meadows, who did not respond to all of Thomas' missives, texted in late November that Trump's challenge of the election results was ""a fight of good versus evil."" The text messages were among the thousands of pages of text messages, emails and documents Meadows voluntarily turned over to the committee last year before he reversed course and decided not to cooperate with the inquiry. Sources familiar with the messages confirmed their authenticity to ABC News. ""Evil always looks like the victor until the King of Kings triumphs,"" Meadows wrote in one text. ""Do not grow weary in well doing. The fight continues. I have staked my career on it. Well at least my time in DC on it."" ""Thank you!! Needed that! This plus a conversation with my best friend just now ... I will try to keep holding on. America is worth it,"" Thomas replied.",6
"The Group of Seven major economies have agreed to reject Moscow’s demand to pay for Russian natural gas exports in rubles Ukrainian forces mount huge counteroffensive against Russia BERLIN -- The Group of Seven major economies agreed Monday to reject Moscow’s demand to pay for Russian natural gas exports in rubles. German energy minister Robert Habeck told reporters that “all G-7 ministers agreed completely that this (would be) a one-sided and clear breach of the existing contracts” for natural gas, which is used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. The energy ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, as well as the European Union energy commissioner, met by videoconference and reaffirmed that contracts “must be respected,"" with most stipulating payments be in euros or dollars, a G-7 statement said. “Payment in ruble is not acceptable, and we will urge the companies affected not to follow (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s demand,” Habeck said. Putin announced last week that Russia will demand “unfriendly"" countries pay for natural gas only in Russian currency from now on, instructing the central bank to work out a procedure for buyers to acquire rubles in Russia. The demand sent already high gas prices even higher amid fears it could be a prelude to a natural gas shutoff, which could disrupt Europe's economy and hurt Russia's finances. Economists said the move appeared designed to try to support the ruble, which has collapsed against other currencies since Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and Western countries responded with far-reaching sanctions against Moscow. But some analysts expressed doubt that it would work. Asked by reporters earlier Monday if Russia could cut natural gas supplies to European customers if they reject the demand to pay in rubles, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call that “we clearly aren’t going to supply gas for free.” “In our situation, it’s hardly possible and feasible to engage in charity for Europe,” Peskov said. Asked what happens if Russia turns off the taps now, Germany’s energy minister said, “We are prepared for all scenarios.” “Putin’s demand to convert the contracts to ruble (means) he is standing with his back to the wall in that regard, otherwise he wouldn’t have made that demand,” Habeck said, adding that Russia needs rubles to finance its war at home, such as payments to troops. European governments have shied away from imposing a ban on energy imports from Russia over fears of the impact it would have on the economy. Europe gets 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil from Russia, and since the war, has scrambled to set out proposals to reduce its dependency. Russia is just as reliant on Europe, with oil and gas its dominant sector and paying for government. Estimates of the impact of a gas boycott or embargo on Europe vary but most involve a substantial loss of economic output, especially since the war and the resulting surge in energy and raw material prices is already weighing on Europe's economy. U.S. sanctions permit exceptions for payments for oil and gas, though it has banned Russian energy imports itself. Putin’s rubles payment proposal led Germany’s utilities association, the BDEW, to call on the government to declare an “early warning” of an energy emergency. A spokeswoman said Monday that the government does not see the need for an early warning declaration at this time. When pressed by reporters on making the declaration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said “the contracts we know lay down the euro as payment currency and the companies will pay according to the contracts they have signed.” What currency is used to buy Russian energy “doesn't really matter,"" said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for the world’s banks. “What matters is that energy exports give Russia purchasing power, which it can convert into goods from abroad,” she said. Putin's demand for payment in rubles “is mostly window dressing. It doesn’t change the underlying transactions,’’ Brooks said. “At the margin, I would call this another ‘own goal’ by Putin, since it increases the focus on gas purchases by Western Europe and could potentially raise the odds of an import stop.” ——— AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed from Washington.",3
"Defense official said Russian troops are still focusing on eastern Ukraine. Ukraine claims its forces have ‘liberated’ key suburb around Kyiv The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 33: Ukraine retakes town south of Sumy The U.S. assesses that Ukrainian forces retook the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in northeast Ukraine, from Russian forces. ""They continue to make progress in that regard,"" said the official, who could not confirm reports of other areas having been retaken by the Ukrainians as was reported by Ukraine this weekend. The official added that Russian forces remain around in a defensive posture, ""and the Ukrainians are continuing to try to take back ground,"" which they've seen in the south and north. Last Friday, the official said Russian troops north of Kyiv had moved into defensive positions around the city and were putting a priority on operations in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The official said Monday that Russian troops around Kyiv have stopped making advances towards the city, though they continue using long-range fires. Russian troops remain 15-20 miles north/northwest of the city and about 35 miles east. Russia has now fired more than 1,370 missiles into Ukraine. ""Static situation on the ground there, except for the fact that we continue to see Ukrainians defend the city and try to to push Russians back as well,"" said the official. The southern strategic city of Kherson remains ""contested territory,"" said the official. On Friday, the official said Kherson, which was seized by Russia early in the fighting, was no longer under full control of Russian forces. Russia prioritizing the Donbas, but US not sure why The official said Russian forces appear to have prioritized operations in eastern Ukraine. The official described Russian forces moving southeast from Izyum as making ""incremental progress"" towards Donbas. ""We're not exactly sure what's behind this reprioritization. All I can tell you is what we're seeing,"" said the official. The U.S. believes it could be to attempt to cut off Ukrainian troops in the east from the rest of the country, to gain leverage for future peace talks or to refocus their strategic goals. Heavy fighting and shelling continues in Mariupol  ""The Ukrainians are slugging it out in Mariupol and they are keeping the Russians at bay there so far,"" said the official. Russian troops entered the southern port city after pounding with artillery and long-range missiles, apparently destroying entire sections of the city. ""We continue to see Mariupol getting slammed by long-range fires,"" the official said. ""We are certainly aware of reports that inside Mariupol the Ukrainians are not only fighting very, very hard, but that they are experiencing their own challenges because you're surrounded,"" the official added. ""It is under incredible pressure by the Russians, but the Ukrainians continue to defend it.""  US troop extensions in eastern Europe?  A major decision of last week's NATO leaders summit in Brussels was that the alliance would establish a long-term presence in eastern Europe as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This includes an additional 6,000 American ground forces moved into eastern Europe to reassure NATO countries that border Russia ahead of that invasion. Now, there are questions about if they will remain there longer than what has been described by the Pentagon as a temporary deployment. The official noted that when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered additional troops to Europe in recent months, ""We made it clear at the time that they will be there for as long as we believe they were necessary to be there, and the secretary continues to believe that they're necessary."" The official characterized them as temporary deployments and said Austin is constantly discussing U.S. troop posture with Gen. Tod Wolters, the commander of U.S. European Command and the top commander of NATO forces, and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Those troops are still there and the secretary assesses that they need to stay there, and so I have no announcements or changes to that posture except for those six Growlers that we talked about this morning and as we as we can talk about, we certainly will,"" said the official. On Monday, the Pentagon announced that six U.S. Navy EA-18 Growler aircraft capable of jamming radars with electronic warfare equipment were being deployed to Germany to reinforce NATO's eastern flank and to deter Russia. ""They are not being deployed to be used against Russian forces in Ukraine,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby stressed in making the announcement. ""They are being deployed completely in keeping with our efforts to bolster NATO's deterrence and defense capabilities along that Eastern flank. They are not being sent because of some sort of acute threat that was perceived or some specific incident that happened."" ""This is in order to bolster readiness, enhance NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our allied and partner nations,"" Kirby said.",6
"With its aspirations for a quick victory dashed by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has increasingly focused on grinding down Ukraine’s military in the east in the hope of forcing Kyiv into surrendering part of the country’s territory to end the war Ukrainian forces mount huge counteroffensive against Russia KYIV, Ukraine -- With its aspirations for a quick victory dashed by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has increasingly focused on grinding down Ukraine's military in the east in the hope of forcing Kyiv into surrendering part of the country's territory to possibly end the war. The bulk of the Ukrainian army is concentrated in eastern Ukraine, where it has been locked up in fighting with Moscow-backed separatists in a nearly eight-year conflict. If Russia succeeds in encircling and destroying the Ukrainian forces in the country's industrial heartland, called Donbas, it could try to dictate its terms to Kyiv and potentially attempt to split the country in two. The Russian military declared Friday that the “first stage of the operation” had been largely accomplished, allowing Russian troops to concentrate on their ""top goal — the liberation of Donbas.” Many observers say the shift in strategy could reflect President Vladimir Putin’s acknowledgment that his plan for a blitz in Ukraine has failed, forcing him to narrow his goals and change tactics amid a disastrous war that has turned Russia into a pariah and decimated its economy. In some sectors, Ukrainian troops have recently pushed the Russians back. In the city of Makariv, near a strategic highway west of the capital, Kyiv, Associated Press reporters saw the carcass of a Russian rocket launcher, a burned Russian truck, the body of a Russian soldier and a destroyed Ukrainian tank after fighting there a few days ago. In the nearby village of Yasnohorodka, the AP witnessed positions abandoned by Ukrainian soldiers who had moved farther west, but no sign of Russian troops’ presence. U.S. and British officials have noted that Moscow has increasingly focused on fighting the Ukrainian forces in the east while digging in around Kyiv and other big cities and pummeling them with rockets and artillery. The chief of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said Sunday the change of focus could reflect Putin’s hope to break Ukraine in two, like North and South Korea, and enforce “a line of separation between the occupied and unoccupied regions.” “He can’t swallow the entire country,” Budanov said, adding that Russia appears to be trying “to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine.” Putin and his generals haven't revealed specific military goals or a planned timeline, but the Kremlin clearly expected a quick victory when Russian troops rolled into Ukraine from the north, east and south on Feb. 24. But the Russian attempts to swiftly capture Kyiv, the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and other big cities in the northeast have been thwarted by well-organized Ukrainian defenses and logistical challenges that stalled the Russian offensive. Russian forces have pounded the outskirts of Kyiv with artillery and air raids from a distance while putting their ground offensive on hold, tactics they also have used in attacking Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy in the northeast. Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military analyst at the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center think tank, said Russia has abandoned attempts to storm Kyiv and other big Ukrainian cities for now and is laying siege to them to try to weaken Ukraine and win time. “Russia has shifted tactics ... to redistribute its forces and prepare for the next active stage of the war,” Sunhurovskyi said. The Russian forces encircled the key strategic port of Mariupol and besieged it for weeks, hammering it with rockets and artillery i n a carnage that killed thousands of civilians. The fall of Mariupol would free up Russian forces there and allow them to engage in a potential pincer movement together with another group of troops moving from Kharkiv in the northeast to try to encircle the Ukrainian military in the east. “Russian forces appear to be concentrating their effort to attempt the encirclement of Ukrainian forces directly facing the separatist regions in the east of the country, advancing from the direction of Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south,” the British Ministry of Defense said Sunday. A senior U.S. defense official, noting the latest Russian focus on Donbas, said Putin may now hope to take full control of the east while keeping other Ukrainian forces occupied with the defense of Kyiv and other areas, then try to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to formally surrender Donbas and recognize Russia's ownership of Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. An analysis published Saturday by the Institute for the Study of War in Washington said the degree to which the Russians can push an accelerated move to cut off Donbas will depend in part on how soon their forces can gain full control of Mariupol and how badly damaged they emerge from that fight. It also noted that a halt in the Russian offensive on Kyiv could reflect ""the incapacity of Russian forces rather than any shift in Russian objectives or efforts at this time.” While the Russian military has focused increasingly on bleeding the Ukrainian troops in the east, it has continued to use its arsenal of air- and sea-launched cruise missiles to methodically target fuel depots, military arsenals and weapons plants across the country. Philips P. O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, described Saturday's cruise missile strikes on Lviv, near the border with Poland, as part of the Russian strategy to cut off supplies to the Ukrainian forces fighting in the east. “They will still want to disrupt as much as possible the flow of goods and supplies from west to east, much of which starts their journey around Lviv,” O'Brien said. On the Black Sea coast, the Russians quickly took the port of Kherson and advanced to the outskirts of the key shipbuilding center of Mykolaiv where their offensive stalled. If the Russian forces succeed in encircling Mykolaiv, Odesa and several other Black Sea ports, it will have completely cut Ukraine’s access to its coast in a devastating blow to its economy. The seizure of Odesa will also allow Moscow to establish a link to the separatist Trans-Dniester region of Moldova that hosts a Russian military base. Despite Ukrainian and Western fears, the Russian army so far hasn't pursued efforts to bypass Mykolaiv and march on Odesa. Ukrainian authorities have noted that Russia's failure to press its offensive along the coast could be explained by the fact that most of its troops in the south have remained locked in the battle for Mariupol where they have suffered heavy losses. On Friday, the Russian military reported it had lost 1,351 soldiers killed and 3,825 wounded since the start of the campaign, but NATO estimates 7,000 to 15,000 have been killed — potentially as many as the Soviet Union lost in the entire 10-year war in Afghanistan. The big losses and slow pace of the Russian offensive could be a factor that forced Putin to lower his ambitions and take a more realistic approach. Volodymyr Fesenko, the head of the independent Kyiv-based Penta Center, said Russia’s declared shift to the east could be an attempt to put a good face on its failed blitz and regroup before the next stage of fighting. “Both sides need a break now for various reasons, and the Kremlin is using it to regroup its forces and search for new tactics without changing its strategic goal of subduing Ukraine,” Fesenko told the AP. “Tactics could change from a blitz to laying siege to cities, destroying the economy and the infrastructure with bombardment, blockading ports and doing other things. Putin has a broad arsenal of means of pressure.” “The stiff Ukrainian resistance could turn the war into a protracted conflict, and then the issue of financial and military resources, including warplanes and tanks Zelenskyy is urging the West to provide will be of primary importance,” he said. ——— Karmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

"He said the committee will discuss possible action after Judge Jackson's vote. Wife of SCOTUS justice texted Trump official about overturning 2020 election  The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chairman Dick Durbin, is calling on Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from Jan. 6-related cases following reports that Thomas' wife, Ginni Thomas, had exchanged texts with then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, urging him to attempt to overthrow the 2020 election results. Durbin said Monday that the development ""raises a serious question about conflict of interest for Justice Thomas."" ""To think that he would consider a case where his wife is frequently contacting the chief of staff for the president and giving advice on matters that are going to be ultimately litigated by the court,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""For the good of the court, I think he should recuse himself from those cases."" Sources familiar with the text messages, which were obtained by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, confirmed their authenticity to ABC News. The content of the messages was first reported by The Washington Post and CBS News. ""Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!"" Thomas wrote to Meadows on Nov. 10 after the election was officially called for Joe Biden. ""You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History."" ""Evil always looks like the victor until the King of Kings triumphs,"" Meadows wrote. ""Do not grow weary in well doing. The fight continues. I have staked my career on it. Well at least my time in DC on it."" The Supreme Court then declined to block the Jan. 6 committee from obtaining Trump White House records in January over the objection of only one justice: Clarence Thomas. Pressed as to whether the Senate Judiciary intends to take action on or investigate the matter, Durbin said the committee would have those discussions once they deal with the pending nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the Supreme Court. ""There's plenty of time and plenty of reason for us to debate this in the future,"" Durbin said. ""But for the time being. I want to make sure this vacancy is filled with Judge Jackson."" Durbin added there are ""a lot of things for which we will discuss"" after Jackson's confirmation vote, but that he is ""troubled to say the least by the disclosures about what Justice Thomas's wife has been doing."" President Biden, meanwhile, is attempting to stay out of the debate over whether Thomas should recuse himself, saying Monday at a White House event unveiling his budget that he would ""leave that to two entities."" “One, the January 6th committee and two the Justice Department. That's their judgment, not mine to make,"" Biden said. The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is also debating whether or not to ask Ginni Thomas for her voluntary cooperation and is meeting on Monday evening to discuss whether to hold former Trump aides Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in contempt of Congress for their refusal to comply with subpoenas. Sources say there are others on the panel who believe the committee should take the more aggressive step of attempting to compel her testimony via subpoena. Pressed further on Monday to take his own position, the president was unwavering. “I told you those things get into legal issues. That, in fact, I told you I would not tell the Justice Department what position to take or not take. And I'm not going to instruct the Congress either,"" he said to reporters. The messages -- more than two dozen between Thomas and Meadows in November of 2020, and one from Jan. 10 -- were among the thousands of pages of text messages, emails and documents Meadows voluntarily turned over to the committee last year, before he reversed course and decided not to cooperate with the inquiry. Thomas did not respond to an earlier request for comment from ABC News. A spokesman for the committee declined to comment on the messages or their contents. ""There were some eyebrows raised when Justice Thomas was that lone vote,"" said Kate Shaw, ABC News Supreme Court analyst and Cardozo Law professor. ""But he did not explain himself, so we don't actually know why he wished to take up the case."" There are no explicit ethics guidelines that govern the activities of a justice's spouse, experts say, but there are rules about justices avoiding conflicts of interest. Federal law requires that federal judges recuse themselves from cases whenever their ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" ABC News' Katherine Faulders, Benjamin Siegel, Devin Dwyer, Justin Gomez and Libby Cathey contributed to this report.",6
"He said he was ""expressing moral outrage"" to the Russian people on Saturday. White House backtracks after Biden says Putin 'cannot remain in power' President Joe Biden appeared to want to both ways when he fielded a barrage of questions Monday asking him to clarify his comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" He stood by his words ""expressing moral outrage"" but also clarified that he wasn't ""articulating a policy change."" Biden -- who made the apparently unscripted comment in Poland on Saturday -- took questions from reporters Monday afternoon at an event unveiling his latest budget proposal, which includes $6.9 billion to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression. The first question to Biden was: ""Do you believe what you said, that Putin can't remain in power, or do you now regret saying that? Because your government has been trying to walk that back, did your words complicate matters?"" ""Number one, I'm not walking anything back. The fact of the matter is I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing and the acts of this man just -- brutality, half the children in Ukraine. I had just come from being with those families, and so -- but I want to make it clear, I wasn't then nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing the moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it,"" Biden said. Biden went on to say that he does not think the comment complicates the diplomacy of this moment. ""The fact is that we're in a situation where it complicates the situation at the moment is the escalatory efforts of Putin to continue to engage in carnage. The kind of behavior that makes the whole world say, 'My God, what is this man doing?' That's what complicates things a great deal and -- but I don't think it complicates it all,"" Biden added. ""I was expressing my outrage. He shouldn't remain in power. Just like, you know, bad people shouldn't continue to do bad things. But it doesn't mean we have a fundamental policy to do anything to take Putin down in any way,"" Biden said. Pressed by ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if he's confident Putin doesn't see his words as escalatory, Biden said, ""I don't care what he thinks."" ""Given his behavior, people should understand that he is going to do what he thinks he should do, period. He's not affected by anybody else including, unfortunately, his own advisers. This is a guy who goes to the beat of his own drummer. And the idea that he is going to do something outrageous because I called him for what he was and what he's doing, I think is just not rational,"" Biden said. He told another reporter that another meeting with Putin, ""depends on what he wants to talk about."" Asked why he made the comment closing out his four-day alliance-building trip that was not in his prepared remarks, Biden said he was ""talking directly to the Russian people."" ""The last part of the speech was talking to the Russian people, telling them what we thought. I was communicating this to not only the Russian people but the whole world. This is -- this is just stating a simple fact that this kind of behavior is totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. And the way to deal with it is to strengthen and put -- keep NATO completely united and help Ukraine where we can,"" he said. ""Nobody believes we're going to take down, I was talking gonna go -- about taking down Putin,"" Biden added. ""Nobody believes that."" Pressed further, Biden repeated he was ""expressing the moral outrage I felt toward this man"" and ""wasn't articulating a policy change."" Biden also told reporters Sunday evening he was not calling for Putin's removal from office, after the White House and some Democrats scrambled to explain the president was not endorsing regime change in Russia as a policy goal. ""The president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change,"" a White House official said after the speech. ""I think the president, the White House made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,"" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday. ""As you've heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter. In this case, as in any case, it's up to the people of the country in question. It's up to the Russian people."" Putin's allies, meanwhile, have appeared to take the comment as escalatory rhetoric, and the fallout could undermine diplomatic efforts to end the war. ""That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians,"" said Kremlin spokesperson Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Biden also called Putin a ""butcher"" over the weekend, after meeting with refugees in Poland. His language drew a rebuke from France's President Emmanuel Macron, who was asked about Biden calling Putin a ""butcher"" and saying he ""cannot remain in power."" ""I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin,"" Macron said in an interview with France 3. ""Because what do we want to do collectively? We want to stop the war that Russia launched in Ukraine, without waging war and without escalation."" The dustup comes as recent polls have shown growing frustration with Biden's handling of Ukraine, even while most Americans favor specific steps the president has taken. According to recent ABC News/Ipsos data, 70% of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of gas prices, for instance, though even more respondents -- 77% -- support his proposal to ban Russian oil, even if it means paying more at the pump. Biden has stepped up his rhetoric in recent weeks as the fighting in Ukraine has worsened. At least twice in the last month, he has called the Russian president a ""war criminal,"" adding he thinks Putin ""will meet the legal definition."" The State Department announced last week Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine but did not specially name Putin.",6
"Analysts in Kyiv are assessing damages and estimating the financial value. Infrastructure damage in Ukraine costs billions LONDON -- The cost of direct damage to Ukraine's infrastructure amid Russia's ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated $63 billion, according to an analysis by the Kyiv School of Economics. Shocking images and videos have emerged in recent weeks showing just some of the devastation across Ukraine since Russian forces attacked on Feb. 24. Where businesses, homes, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure once stood, there are now massive piles of unrecognizable rubble and crumbling shells of concrete. The KSE Institute, an analytical unit of the Kyiv School of Economics in Ukraine's capital, has been collecting and analyzing data from the ""Russia Will Pay"" project, launched in collaboration with the Ukrainian president's office and the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy. Through the resource, Ukrainian citizens, government officials and local authorities can confidentially submit reports on the loss of or damage to physical infrastructure across the country as a result of the war, including roads, residential buildings, businesses and other facilities. Analysts at the KSE Institute then assess those reported damages and estimate the financial value. ""It is aimed at collecting information about all the facilities destroyed as a result of the war that Russia waged against Ukraine,"" the KSE Institute said in a recent statement about the ""Russia Will Pay"" resource. ""The Ukrainian government will use this data as evidence in international courts for Russia to compensate for the intended damages."" The latest analysis shows that, as of March 24, at least 4,431 residential buildings, 92 factories and warehouses, 378 institutions of secondary and higher education, 138 health care institutions, 12 airports, seven thermal power plants and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, destroyed or seized in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 -- totaling an estimated $62,889,000. Compared to the previous estimate published on March 17, net growth amounted to $3.5 billion, according to the KSE Institute. Meanwhile, Ukraine's overall economic losses due to the war -- taking into account both direct losses calculated from the project as well as indirect losses, like GDP decline -- range from $543 billion to $600 billion, according to an estimate by the KSE Institute and the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy. Before updating its calculations, the KSE Institute said it received ""detailed data"" from the Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure on the destruction of its facilities, which allowed analysts to clarify and, in some cases, reduce the assessment of losses. The KSE Institute said it has improved the methodology of assessing losses from the destruction of residential real estate ""based on the World Bank’s experience in analyzing losses in Syria and Iraq, as well as the recommendations of the leading Ukrainian investment company Dragon Capital."" ""These calculations are based on the analysis of several thousands of public notifications from Ukrainian citizens, the government, local authorities about losses and damages throughout the country, as well as indirect assessment methods such as calculating the estimated area of the war-damaged property in the most affected cities,"" the KSE Institute said. ""These estimates are not exhaustive: information on numerous damages and destruction may be missing due to the inability of citizens, local and state authorities to promptly record the damage in each city and town.""",6
"The Pentagon says it may have to go back to Congress for additional money to support Ukraine’s battle to defeat Russia’s invasion Ukraine latest: Further attacks push more Ukrainians to flee WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon may have to ask Congress for additional money to support Ukraine's battle against Russia’s invasion, including to replenish America's arsenal for weapons sent to Kyiv, officials said. Rolling out the Defense Department's $773 billion request for fiscal 2023, Pentagon leaders said Monday the budget was finalized before the invasion so it has no specific money for the war. Congress approved a $13.5 billion emergency funding package in early March. The leaders said it was too early to predict how quickly Ukrainian forces will use up the weapons and ammunition already being provided, and how much the U.S. will need to replace what it sends to Ukraine, such as Stinger and Javelin missiles or body armor and other equipment. “We’ll have to look at this again, probably in the summer, to be prepared for some of the more difficult options,” said Pentagon comptroller Michael McCord. “In the initial phases, at least, obviously we have been running through that drawdown at a fairly high rate. So, were that to continue, yes, we probably would need to address that again in the future.” Despite the war in Europe, McCord said the U.S. still views China as America's top challenge. “We did not feel that what’s happening today altered the picture that China is the No. 1 issue to keep our eye on,” he said. “Obviously, you can draw your own conclusions about Russia’s performance on the battlefield.” As the war enters its second month, the U.S. has been sending troops, aircraft and other weapons to NATO's eastern flank, where nations worry they may be Russia's next targets. The Pentagon said the budget recognizes that Russia is an “acute threat,"" and the totals include more than $5 billion to provide support to European allies and increase America's ability to work with them. The budget also invests heavily in high-tech weapons and capabilities needed to counter China, Russia and other adversaries. The programs range from hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence to cyber warfare and space-based missile warning and defense systems. The 2023 budget plan includes a 4.6% pay hike for the military and for Defense Department civilians — the largest raise in 20 years. And it provides $479 million to expand sexual assault prevention, treatment and judicial programs, including the hiring of about 2,000 personnel, including counselors and prosecutors. The department also is seeking $1 billion to continue efforts to shut down the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii that leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor’s tap water. The money is in addition to $1 billion already allocated, and will help pay for remediation of the site, ongoing needs of the affected families, litigation costs and the development of alternative fuel locations for the U.S. military in the region. Nearly 6,000 people, mostly those living in military housing at or near Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam were sickened, seeking treatment for nausea, headaches, rashes and other ailments. And 4,000 military families were forced out of their homes. The budget includes $34.4 billion to accelerate modernization of the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal, largely following the path set by the Obama administration and continued by former President Donald Trump. One of the few changes was a decision by the Biden administration to eliminate plans for a sea-launched nuclear cruise missile. That program, started by Trump and criticized by many Democrats as overkill, was in the early stages of research and development. Other cuts are proposed in the budget including the decommissioning of several ships, a reduction in the number of F-35 fighter jets purchased in 2023 compared with earlier plans, and an effort to phase out the Air Force's A-10 attack aircraft. Congress has repeatedly overruled efforts to cut the A-10 in the past. ——— AP National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.",6
"The U_N_ food chief is warning that the war in Ukraine has created “a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe” and will have a global impact “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II.” Warsaw mayor: 'We need help … we cannot do it alone' on refugee influx UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. food chief warned Tuesday the war in Ukraine has created “a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe” and will have a global impact “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II"" because many of the Ukrainian farmers who produce a significant amount of the world’s wheat are now fighting Russians. David Beasley, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, told the U.N. Security Council that already high food prices are skyrocketing. His agency was feeding 125 million people around the world before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, and Beasley said it has had to start cutting their rations because of rising food, fuel and shipping costs. He pointed to war-torn Yemen where 8 million people just had their food allotment cut 50%, “and now we’re looking at going to zero rations.” The war in Ukraine is turning “the breadbasket of the world to breadlines” for millions of its people, while devastating countries like Egypt that normally gets 85% of its grain from Ukraine and Lebanon that got 81% in 2020, Beasley said. Ukraine and Russia produce 30% of the world's wheat supply, 20% of its corn and 75%-80% of the sunflower seed oil. The World Food Program buys 50% of its grain from Ukraine, he said. The war is going to increase the agency's monthly expenses by $71 million because of rising food, fuel and shipping costs, he said. That will total $850 million for a year and mean that there will be “4 million less people we’ll be able to reach.” Beasley said the World Food Program is reaching about a million people inside Ukraine with food now, and will reach 2.5 million over the next four weeks, 4 million by the end of May and hopefully 6 million by the end of June. The price tag is about $500 million for the first three months and “we are short by about $300 million so we’re going to need to step up,” he said. Beasley warned that focusing on Ukraine should not lead the international community to neglect of Africa, especially the Sahel, and the Middle East, because “otherwise, you’ll have massive migration” coming to all parts of Europe. “If we end the conflict, address the needs, we can avoid famine, destabilization of nations and mass migration,” he said. “But if we don’t, the world will pay a mighty price and the last thing we want to do as the World Food Program is taking food from hungry children to give to starving children.” U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said that “President (Vladimir) Putin’s war of choice” is responsible for damaging global food security. “Russia has bombed at least three civilian ships carrying goods from Black Sea ports to the rest of the world, including one chartered by an agribusiness company,” she said. “The Russian navy is blocking access to Ukraine’s ports, essentially cutting off exports of grain.” “They are reportedly preventing approximately 94 ships carrying food for the world market from reaching the Mediterranean,” Sherman said, adding that many shipping companies are hesitating to send vessels into the Black Sea, even to Russian ports. As Russia “chokes off Ukrainian exports,” food prices are skyrocketing, with wheat prices rising between 20% and 50% so far this year, she said. “We are particularly concerned about countries like Lebanon, Pakistan, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Morocco which rely heavily on Ukrainian imports to feed their population,” Sherman said. Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, retorted that the Russian military is “posing no threat to the freedom of civilian navigation.” He said that Russia has set up an 80 nautical-mile-long humanitarian corridor to allow foreign vessels to leave Ukrainian ports and that it is organizing humanitarian corridors every day within Ukraine to Russia and the West. “The real reasons why the global food market is facing serious turbulence are by no means in the actions of Russia, (but) rather in the unbridled sanctions hysteria that the West has unleashed against Russia without considering the population of the so-called Global South nor of its own citizens,” Nebenzia said. Lifting sanctions is the only way to ensure uninterrupted shipments and stabilize international agricultural and food markets, he said. Sherman countered: “Sanctions aren’t preventing grain from leaving Ukraine’s ports. Putin’s war is. And Russia’s own food and agricultural exports are not under sanction by the U.S. or by our allies and partners.” France and Mexico called for the council meeting to follow up on the General Assembly’s adoption of a humanitarian resolution on Ukraine that they initiated that was adopted overwhelmingly Thursday by a vote of 140-5, with 38 abstentions. It demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and infrastructure essential for their survival, and unimpeded access to deliver desperately needed aid. French Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere told the Security Council, which has not passed a Ukraine resolution because of Russia's veto power, that “it is Russia’s unjustified and unjustifiable war that is preventing Ukraine from exporting grain, disrupting global supply chains, and driving up prices that threaten the accessibility of agricultural commodities for the most vulnerable.” Russia’s aggression against Ukraine increases the risk of famine in the world,” he warned. “People in developing countries are first to be affected.”",6
"The House panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol has identified a roughly 8-hour gap in official White House records of then-President Donald Trump’s phone calls as the violence unfolded and his supporters stormed the building Jan. 6 investigation uncovers 7-hour gap in White House call records WASHINGTON -- The House panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol has identified an almost 8-hour gap in official White House records of then-President Donald Trump's phone calls as the violence unfolded and his supporters stormed the building, according to two people familiar with the probe. The gap extends from a little after 11 a.m. to about 7 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, and involves White House phone calls, according to one of the people. Both spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation. The committee is investigating the gap in the official White House log, which includes the switchboard and a daily record of the president's activities. But it does not mean the panel is in the dark about what Trump was doing during that time. The House panel has made broad requests for separate cell phone records and has talked to more than 800 witnesses, including many of the aides who spent the day with Trump. The committee also has thousands of texts from the cell phone of Mark Meadows, who was then Trump's chief of staff. The committee’s effort to piece together Trump’s day as his supporters broke into the Capitol underscores the challenge that his habitual avoidance of records laws poses — not only to historians of his tumultuous four years but to the House panel, which intends to capture the full story of the former president’s attempt to overturn the election results in hearings and reports later this year. The committee has trained a particular focus on what the president was doing in the White House as hundreds of his supporters beat police, broke into the Capitol and interrupted the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory. The missing records raise questions of whether Trump purposefully circumvented official channels to avoid records. Trump was known to use other people’s cell phones to make calls, as well as his own. He often bypassed the White House switchboard, placing calls directly, according to a former aide who requested anonymity to discuss the private calls. It is not unusual for presidential calls to be channeled through other people. It is unclear whether the committee has obtained records of cell phone calls made that day. The panel issued a broad records preservation order in August to almost three dozen telecommunications and social media companies, demanding that the companies save communications for several hundred people in case Congress decided to issue subpoenas for them. Individuals included in that request included Trump, members of his family and several of his Republican allies in Congress. The committee also is continuing to receive records from the National Archives and other sources, which could produce additional information and help produce a full picture of the president's communications. While hundreds of people have cooperated with the probe, in some cases the panel has been hampered by Trump's assertions of executive privilege over material and interviews. Courts have overruled his efforts to block some documents, but many witnesses who are still close to the former president — and several who were in the White House that day — have declined to answer the committee's questions. Biden, who has authority as the sitting president over his predecessor's White House privilege claims, said Tuesday he would reject Trump's claims concerning the testimony of his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner. Kushner, who was one of Trump's top White House aides, is scheduled for an interview with the panel on Thursday. The committee has requested an interview with Ivanka Trump as well, but has not said whether she will comply. During the roughly eight hours on Jan. 6, Trump addressed a huge crowd of supporters at the nearby Ellipse, repeated falsehoods about his election defeat and told them to walk to the Capitol, make their voices heard and “fight like hell.” He then returned to the White House and watched as the mob broke into the Capitol. More than 700 people have been arrested in the violence. Several of Trump's calls that day are already publicly known. He spoke to Vice President Mike Pence between 11 a.m. and 11:30, according to a person familiar with that conversation, as he had been lobbying Pence publicly and privately to object while presiding over the certification. He also spoke with several GOP members of the House and Senate as his allies in Congress were preparing to challenge the official vote count. He had a tense conversation with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who asked him to call off the mob, according to Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who shared McCarthy's account shortly after the insurrection. Trump responded that the rioters must be ""more upset about the election than you are,"" according to Herrera Beutler. Trump also talked to Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, among other lawmakers. Tuberville has said he spoke to the president while the Senate was being evacuated. Utah Sen. Mike Lee has said that Trump accidentally called him when he was trying to reach Tuberville. The White House log does show calls Trump made before that time period, as he was preparing to speak at the rally. That log shows calls with his former aide Steve Bannon, conservative commentator William Bennett and Sean Hannity of Fox News, according to one of the people familiar with the records. The gap in the phone records was previously reported by the AP. The exact length of time of the gap was first reported jointly by The Washington Post and CBS News. Trump had no immediate comment Tuesday, but he has previously disparaged the investigation and sued to stop records production. ——— Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",3
"The Jan. 6 committee is wrestling with how far to extend the investigation. Capitol insurrection: Tracking the attack 1 year later The TAKE with Rick Klein President Joe Biden almost made it sound easy when he declined to comment on the latest revelations about Ginni Thomas’ efforts to urge officials to try to overturn the election, saying he would leave such matters to the Jan. 6 committee and the Justice Department: ""That’s their judgment, not mine, to make."" But recent events only serve to underscore the stakes around decisions not yet made -- or at least not yet revealed publicly -- by both of those entities. The House Jan. 6 committee is still wrestling with how and whether to seek information from Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in a probe that has already threatened to grow to unwieldy proportions. The committee is still gathering new information -- Jared Kushner is slated to appear this week -- with a tight timeline for public hearings and writing a final report. Thomas is only the latest potential witness to prompt dissent inside the committee over how far to extend aspects of the investigation. And a win for the committee in court on Monday, forcing attorney John Eastman to hand over emails, means more documents, along with a good measure more pressure on the Justice Department. Judge David Carter crossed an important threshold with his finding that it is ""more likely than not that President Trump"" committed a crime on Jan. 6. Such a sentence would matter orders of magnitude more, however, if the Justice Department agrees. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been preparing all along for lengthy investigations, including in his department’s budget request this week for an additional 131 new attorneys to handle Jan. 6-related inquiries. Biden can take himself out of making the critical decisions. That, though, doesn’t take the politics out of some of the most significant choices that will have to come out of both Congress and law-enforcement entities. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The Biden administration is pushing a $5.8 trillion budget proposal with aims to drive down the deficit and tackle inflation. White House officials have described the plan as ""fiscally responsible"" and say it would decrease the deficit by $1.3 trillion over one year. That claim is an important one, considering the timing for the Biden administration. It is considered an appeal to the middle as time ticks toward midterm elections that could have unsavory outcomes for Democrats. To avoid a repeat of the failure of Biden’s Build Back Better spending plan, Biden needs to get Sen. Joe Manchin on board, and playing up a deficit reduction could help him do it. The plan calls for increases in funding for law enforcement to combat crime and for national security spending amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, items that could garner bipartisan support. Other top lines from the plan include funding for mental health care, veterans services and cancer prevention. On inflation, the plan calls for investments to address supply chain issues, including port infrastructure and shoring up railways that carry freight. It also aims to invest in affordable housing. White House officials told reporters Monday that deficit reduction efforts, in addition to investments, would address inflation long-term, but they didn’t guarantee short-term relief for the soaring costs Americans are enduring coast to coast. ""We believe the policies in this budget will further reduce the deficit by another trillion over the next decade,"" Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said. ""A lower deficit will help ease long-term inflationary pressures and make our fiscal trajectory more sustainable."" Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young is slated to testify to the House Budget Committee on Tuesday about the president’s proposed budget. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema  Although the date of the upcoming special election in Texas' 34th congressional district is yet to be determined, the race is already shaping up as an opportunity for the GOP to spotlight the party's efforts to forge inroads with Latino voters and diversify its field of candidates. The contest to replace outgoing Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela will happen within the district's old borders, rather than its new redistricted parameters, offering Republicans hope that they can claim the district, if even for a short time before November's general election. The older district outlined an area that President Joe Biden won by about four points, but according to FiveThirtyEight's redistricting analysis, the new contours of the district -- which this fall's contest will encompass -- resulted in an area that favors Democrats by 17 points. Earlier this year, the current Republican candidate in the running for the 34th district, Mayra Flores, offered testimony during a redistricting hearing that pushed back on the redistricting changes being imposed under her own party's proposals. At the time, Flores said the changes created by the new map prevented her from significantly challenging a Democratic opponent, while also ignoring the impact Latino conservatives could have on the political landscape. As reported by ABC News' Brittany Shepherd, Rep. Elise Stefanik backed Flores and acknowledged the possible benefits of competing under the older map while speaking at a Monday press conference to announce the latest round of endorsements for her political action committee, which seeks to elevate conservative women candidates. ""In the Texas' 34th [congressional district] seat as its currently configured … Joe Biden only won this district by four points. Given how under water he is today, at historically low polling, given the multiple crises that voters are facing, whether its inflation, energy prices or the border crises that we see first-hand in Texas, we think we have a ripe opportunity to pick up this seat,"" Stefanik said. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 11. People were 11 percentage points less likely to say they would accept a Muslim refugee than a Christian one in a huge study of public opinion in Europe. Recent polls have found support for taking in refugees fleeing Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion is high across Europe -- much higher than the last time Europe faced a sudden influx of refugees in 2015, when more than a million people from several Middle Eastern and African countries sought asylum fleeing the Syrian civil war. Many factors explain the difference, as FiveThirtyEight’s Laura Bronner reports, but studies have found that race and religion are two of the biggest in determining which refugees are accepted versus turned away.

"Florida and 20 other states have sued to halt the federal government's pandemic requirement that people wear masks on planes, trains and other public transport FDA expected to authorize additional booster for adults 50 and older  ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Twenty-one states with Republican attorneys general sued Tuesday to halt the federal government’s requirement that people wear masks on planes, trains, ferries and other public transportation amid the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit, announced by Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General Ashley Moody and filed in federal court in Tampa, Florida, contends that the mask mandate exceeds the authority of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mandate in its current form may be in effect only a few weeks more. The CDC recently extended it until April 18 while also indicating it is weighing scaling back the rules for a more targeted approach. Still, Florida and the other states are pressing on with the lawsuit, which comes amid a partisan divide over the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and issues of government control versus individual rights. “It is well past time to get rid of this unnecessary mandate and get back to normal life,” said DeSantis, a Republican who has persistently challenged federal mask mandates including those involving cruise lines, schools, private businesses and other entities. The CDC rule, effective Feb. 1, 2021, requires “the wearing of masks by people on public transportation conveyances or on the premises of transportation hubs,” according to the agency website. The rule has been relaxed somewhat, to end requirements for certain buses, but was recently extended until at least April 18 for domestic and international travel in general. Moody, a Republican and former Tampa judge, said in a news release that the travel mask mandates “are frustrating travelers and causing chaos on public transportation.” That appeared to be a reference to a spate of well-publicized confrontations between flight attendants and passengers over the mask requirement on commercial aircraft. It’s not clear if these incidents are isolated or widespread, and if masks are the only issue. Some are clearly alcohol-related or a mental health problem. Also, perhaps underscoring the partisan divide on masks, both DeSantis and Moody mentioned Democratic President Joe Biden several times in their statements against the travel mandate. The Atlanta-based CDC did not immediately respond to a phone call and email requesting comment on the lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks to immediately halt the CDC travel mask rule and asks for costs and attorneys' fees. There have been similar lawsuits filed in individual states before this latest one. Besides Florida, the states filing the new travel mask lawsuit as of Tuesday were: — Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.",6
"""What they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere."" Russia signals major shift in strategy The Pentagon is seeing ""small numbers"" of Russian troops repositioning to the north of Kyiv but is not labeling it a withdrawal as Russia has characterized it. Instead, it believes the troops might be used in an offensive elsewhere in Ukraine, possibly into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. After holding talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Turkey, Russia's defense ministry said it was withdrawing forces from around Kyiv and Chernihiv as ""a good faith"" measure in the talks. However, the move coincided with the Russian military's lack of success in its moves on the two northern cities. ""We're seeing a small number now that appears to be moving away from Kyiv,"" John Kirby, the Pentagon's top spokesman, told reporters Tuesday. ""This on the same day that the Russians say they're withdrawing, but we're not prepared to call this a retreat, or even a withdrawal. What they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere."" ""It's certainly not a significant chunk of the multiple battalion tactical groups that Russia has arrayed against Kyiv,"" Kirby said. ""It's not anywhere near a majority of what they have arrayed"" around Ukraine's capital. He noted the Russians have said in recent days that it has made the Donbas area a priority. ""We believe that it is likely more repositioning to be used elsewhere in Ukraine. Where exactly we don't know,"" he said. ""We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over. "" Kirby expressed similar skepticism about the Russian announcement from other top Biden administration officials, including President Joe Biden. ""We're not taking anything they say at face value,"" Kirby said. ""We're not we're not prepared to buy the Russian argument that it's a withdrawal. Again, our assessment is that their intention is to reposition forces and bolster their efforts elsewhere."" Though Kirby said Russian troops had repeatedly failed in their military objectives in Ukraine, particularly in taking Kyiv, he declined to characterize the Russian move as a defeat. ""I don't think we're prepared to slap a bumper sticker on this thing right now,"" Kirby said. ""I mean, there are still people dying. There's still bombs falling. There's still missiles flying. And they're still give and take on the battlefield. So I don't think we're ready to call it one way or another here."" Earlier on Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia's invasion was ""a pivotal moment in Europe with generational implications"" that had strengthened the NATO alliance. Wolters said American troop levels in Europe had risen from 60,000 to 100,000 due to the invasion and said more troops might be needed. ""My suspicion is we're going to still need more,"" Wolters said. ""And obviously, there's always a mix between the requirement of permanent versus rotational and there are pluses and minuses of each one. We'll have to continue to examine the European contributions to make a smart decision about where to go in the future."" During his press conference Tuesday, Kirby announced some Marine forces that had recently participated in NATO's Cold Response exercise in Norway would be redirected to Lithuania and Eastern Europe. The Marine units included a command and control unit being sent to Lithuania along with 10 FA-18 fighters and several C-130 transport planes. Wolters praised Ukraine's military and its ability to stall Russian military operations throughout the country, especially through the weapons systems being provided by the U.S. military. ""I think we can, and we will continue to maintain our support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces,"" Wolters said. ""... We've made dramatic improvements in our information and sharing and intelligence sharing."" That support has included the key delivery of American-made Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that have helped the Ukrainian military stall the progress of Russian troops throughout Ukraine. Wolters said the supply line of weapons to the Ukrainians had been successful and had not come under attack. ""They've been delivering right to the right location at the right time,"" Wolters said.",3
"The Trumps have asked for the subpoenas to be quashed.  Judge orders Trump and his children to testify The New York Attorney General's office is urging an appellate court to enforce a subpoena that requires former President Donald Trump and his two eldest children to testify in a civil investigation that’s examining whether there has been fraud within the Trump family real estate business, according to a new court filing. The former president and his eldest children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, have asked the Appellate Division’s First Department to quash the subpoenas, arguing they became improper once the Manhattan District Attorney’s office opened a parallel criminal investigation. “Nothing in the law supports that outcome, which would impermissibly constrain the discretion of the Attorney General, New York’s chief law enforcement officer, to select from among the investigative tools and remedies conferred on her by statute,” Eric Del Pozo, the deputy solicitor general, wrote in a motion filed Tuesday. “Civil subpoenas do not compel appellants to provide information that may be used against them in a future criminal case.” The Trumps have also argued the subpoenas result from an investigation driven by the political animus of New York Attorney General Letitia James, which her office rejected. “Office of Attorney General’s civil investigation began after a corporate insider gave sworn testimony that the Trump Organization had engaged in widespread fraud,"" the filing Tuesday said. ""That fact, along with the substantial evidence collected to date of possible business fraud, amply supports Supreme Court’s finding that the civil subpoenas are part of a valid and well-founded investigation rather than a product of political animus."" Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, testified to Congress in 2019 that the former president valued his real estate holdings differently depending on whether he was seeking loans or tax deductions. Cohen provided Congress with copies of Trump’s financial statements that he said misrepresented the values of Trump assets to obtain favorable terms for loans and insurance. “So far, the investigation has uncovered significant evidence potentially indicating that, for more than a decade, these financial statements relied on misleading asset valuations and other misrepresentations to secure economic benefits—including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions—on terms more favorable than the true facts warranted,” according to the filing Tuesday. Trump, in a statement last month, blasted the probe following a ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron of the New York State Supreme Court that the Trumps must testify. ""She is doing everything within their corrupt discretion to interfere with my business relationships, and with the political process,"" he said of James. ""It is a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in history -- and remember, I can’t get a fair hearing in New York because of the hatred of me by Judges and the judiciary. It is not possible!""",9
"President Joe Biden says he's not yet convinced that Russia’s announcement that it will scale back military operations near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv will lead to a fundamental shift in the war On Location: March 30, 2022 WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Tuesday said he wasn't yet convinced that Russia's announcement that it would scale back military operations near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv will lead to a fundamental shift in the war. Biden, during an appearance with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong following bilateral talks at the White House, said he was waiting to see what Russia offers in ongoing talks with Ukraine and how Moscow readjusts its troop presence. U.S. and Western officials have expressed skepticism about Russia's announcement earlier on Tuesday that it would dial back operations in an effort to increase trust in ongoing talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Turkey. “We’ll see,"" Biden said. ""I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield later expressed an even greater skepticism, saying the administration views any movement of Russian forces as a “redeployment and not a withdrawal"" and “no one should be fooled by Russia's announcement.” “The world should be prepared for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,” Bedingfield said. ""Everyone should expect that we’re going to continue to see attacks across Ukraine."" Biden expressed his caution about the latest development after meeting with Lee for talks in which he sought to assure Singapore and other Pacific allies that his administration remains focused on the Indo-Pacific region even as they deal with the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Biden at the start of an Oval Office meeting with Lee said it was essential that his administration continue to work on bolstering relations with Singapore and other nations in the region. The president has made adjusting U.S. foreign policy to better reflect the rise of America’s most significant military and economic competitor, China, a central focus of his foreign policy, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has complicated the effort. “Even as we address the crisis in Europe, my administration is strongly supportive of moving rapidly to implement the Indo-Pacific strategy,” said Biden, who also held a call Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to discuss developments in Ukraine. Biden and Lee discussed the relationship between the U.S. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, promoting the return of democracy in Myanmar following last year's military coup and advancing economic growth in the region. Biden said he and Lee consulted on the situation in Ukraine and “freedom of the seas,” an issue of heightened importance in the region as Beijing has made territorial claims over most of the South China Sea. Lee acknowledged that the timing of the visit underscored Biden's commitment to the region and that the U.S. would continue to ""strengthen its strategic interests in the region.” “I’m sure you’re completely seized with what’s happening in Europe right now,” Lee said. ""But we doubly appreciate the time you’re giving Singapore and to southeast Asian countries generally, especially ASEAN.” Biden’s national security team has been pleased that Singapore and other Pacific partners — Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — moved relatively quickly to hit Russia with sanctions following the invasion. Lee noted that “the war in Ukraine has implications for the Asia Pacific"" region, a seeming reference to China's saber-rattling toward Taiwan. Concerns were growing even before Russia invaded Ukraine about Beijing's calculations about Taiwan. Biden administration officials have said that Chinese President Xi Jinping has closely watched the U.S. and Western reaction to the Russian invasion. White House officials have also said that China has offered Moscow military and economic help with its prosecution of the war. Any conflict over the self-governing island democracy stands to involve the U.S., which is legally obligated to ensure Taiwan can defend itself and treats threats to the island as matters of grave concern. The Biden administration has repeatedly underscored its “One China” policy, which recognizes Beijing as the government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. Biden also made clear that the U.S. strongly opposes China's unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. “There are potential flashpoints and contentious issues in our region to which if not managed, well, could escalate to open conflict,” Lee said. “Countries with interests in the region need to pursue all efforts to settle disagreements through peaceful means, so that we can avoid reaching a point of no return.” Singapore, which typically waits for United Nations backing before implementing sanctions, has imposed restrictions on some exports and a ban on financial institutions from doing business with Russian banks. Biden thanked Lee for Singapore being a reliable ally, saying the island manages to “punch way above your weight.” Biden was scheduled to host several national leaders from ASEAN this week, but the summit was postponed. Vice President Kamala Harris visited Singapore in August, announcing agreements involving cybersecurity, climate change and supply chain issues. The president on Tuesday said he still planned to host the ASEAN summit this spring. ——— Associated Press writer Chris Megerian contributed reporting.",3
"A federal judge in Texas is barring the Navy from taking action for now against sailors who've objected to being vaccinated against COVID-19 on religious grounds WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in Texas is barring the Navy from taking action for now against sailors who have objected to being vaccinated against COVID-19 on religious grounds. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor had in January issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Navy from disciplining or discharging 35 sailors who sued over the Navy's vaccine policy while their case played out. On Monday, O'Connor agreed the case could go forward as a class action lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction covering the approximately 4,000 sailors who have objected on religious grounds to being vaccinated. O'Connor said the larger group of sailors shared common characteristics with those who had sued. They had asked for and been denied an exemption to the vaccine requirement on religious grounds and were facing the threat of being discharged from the Navy, O'Connor wrote. ""Even though their personal circumstances may factually differ in small ways, the threat is the same — get the jab or lose your job,” wrote O'Connor, who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last year made vaccinations mandatory for service members. More than 99% of the Navy’s active duty force has been vaccinated against COVID-19, and the Navy has also discharged 650 people for refusing to be vaccinated. Navy guidelines allow for exemptions to the vaccine requirement on religious and other grounds, including medical reasons and if a service member is about to leave the Navy. Lawyers for the group of sailors who sued, most of them Navy SEALs, argue that the Navy had granted hundreds of exemptions for medical and administrative reasons but granted no religious exemptions for active duty and reserve service members. Nine inactive reserve members have been granted religious exemptions. Mike Berry, the director of military affairs for First Liberty Institute, which is representing the sailors, said in a statement following O'Connor's action that it's ""time for our military to honor its constitutional obligations and grant religious accommodations for service members with sincere religious objections to the vaccine.” While the case is still at an early stage, the U.S. Supreme Court in a brief order Friday narrowed the impact of O'Connor's original injunction, saying that the Navy could still consider the vaccination status of the sailors who sued in making deployment, assignment and other operational decisions. O'Connor's latest injunction allows the Navy to consider vaccination status in making those decisions about members of the larger group as well. President Joe Biden's administration had argued that not allowing the Navy to consider vaccination status in making assignments posed “intolerable risks to safety and mission success.” “Navy personnel routinely operate for extended periods of time in confined spaces that are ripe breeding grounds for respiratory illnesses, where mitigation measures such as distancing are impractical or impossible,"" Biden administration lawyers wrote. “A SEAL who falls ill not only cannot complete his or her own mission, but risks infecting others as well, particularly in close quarters, including on submarines.” ——— Associated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed to this report.",6
"The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians has denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an “atrocious"" act that is causing enormous suffering WARSAW, Poland -- The spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians on Tuesday denounced Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an “atrocious"" act that is causing enormous suffering. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I didn't mention Russia by name in comments made during a visit to Warsaw after meeting with Ukrainian refugees. Poland has accepted the largest number of people fleeing the war in Ukraine. “It is simply impossible to imagine how much devastation this atrocious invasion has caused for the Ukrainian people and the entire world,” Bartholomew said at a news briefing. He added that solidarity with Ukrainians “is the only thing that can overcome evil and darkness in the world.” Bartholomew also met with Archbishop Stanis?aw G?decki, the head of the Polish Bishops' Conference, who went even further in his denunciation of Russian actions, which he said bore “the hallmarks of genocide."" Unlike Bartholomew, G?decki mentioned Russia by name. G?decki said Russia's invasion has resulted in the deaths of “thousands of innocent people"" including “hundreds of children, elderly people, women, and men who had nothing to do with the hostilities."" “Many of the aggressor’s actions bear the hallmarks of genocide,” G?decki said. The Polish church leader earlier this month urged the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, to use his influence with Russian President Vladimir Putin to demand an end to the war and for Russian soldiers to stand down — going further than Pope Francis in his public statements to date. Istanbul-based Bartholomew is considered “first among equals"" among Orthodox patriarchs. Although the titular head of the Orthodox Church worldwide, other Orthodox leaders — including Kirill — are able to wield more power from their base in countries with larger Orthodox populations. Ukraine's population is mostly Orthodox Christian, but is divided between an independent church based in Kyiv and another one loyal to Kirill in Moscow. Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church severed contact with Bartholomew after the Istanbul patriarch recognized the Orthodox Church of Ukraine as independent of the Moscow patriarch in 2019. Even though Putin justified his invasion of Ukraine in part as a defense of the Moscow-oriented Orthodox church, leaders of both Ukrainian Orthodox factions have fiercely condemned the Russian invasion, as has Ukraine’s significant Catholic minority. Bartholomew said it was hard to find words to describe the suffering of the Ukrainians he met in Poland and referred to scripture instead, quoting prophet Jeremiah: “If my head was a spring of water, and if my eyes were a fountain of tears, I would weep all day and night for the slaying of my people.” ———— Follow all AP stories on Russia’s war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub.russia-ukraine",3
"One government model predicts 18,000 migrants a day.  Title 42 explained by Terry Moran The Department of Homeland Security is bracing for as many as 18,000 migrants per day at the southern border if Title 42 is revoked, according to senior DHS officials who briefed reporters on Tuesday. The DHS officials said they have ""no idea"" when Title 42, the controversial Trump administration policy that deports single adults under the auspices of a public health emergency, will be lifted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently conducting a review of Title 42, which must be completed by March 30. An announcement on whether it will be renewed is expected soon thereafter. Officials said they have run through three scenarios and the highest level of migrants coming across the border per day was 18,000. They stressed it is only a prediction and they are prepared for anything. DHS has also established a joint information center with officials from across the federal government. ""I think it's unclear what the impact of Title 42 potentially lifting in the coming days, weeks or months would be on migratory flows, but we need to be prepared for considering a potential contingency, which is that the lifting of Title 42 could increase flows and so that is definitely part of this planning process,"" one senior DHS official said. ABC News obtained a strategic plan outlining the steps DHS will take in ""response to irregular migration patterns."" The 16-page document specifically says the lifting of Title 42 will likely ""cause a significant increase along all United States borders -- primarily along the Southwest border."" ""The DHS Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) produced projections for post-Title 42 Southwest Border encounters describing low, medium, high, or very high encounter scenarios,"" the document says. ""These scenarios underpin planning assumptions that generate requirements which in turn drive operational execution. Based on these projections the SBCC is currently planning for 6,000, 12,000 (high) and 18,000 (very high) encounters per day."" In the event of large migration numbers along the border, Customs and Border Protection is prepared to more than double their air and bus transportation capabilities and beef up CBP agents at surge points. The agency is looking at ways to make the situation more tenable if an influx of migrants does come, such as establishing an online preregistration system and sending more CBP officers to the border. The department is setting up temporary facilities in anticipation of high migrant levels. There was an average of 5,892 apprehensions along the southwest border each day in February, according to CBP data, an increase from 2021 when there were an average of 4,753 per day for the calendar year. ""We are now seeing 40% of our monthly encounters coming from countries that are not Mexico, or the Northern Triangle countries of Central America. That is frankly unprecedented and something that is concerning not just to us, but to the government of Mexico and other countries in the region,"" one senior official told reporters, noting that they are seeing an influx of Nicaraguan, Cuban and Venezuelan nationals.",2
"The second booster will reportedly only be offered, not recommended. What to know about reported 2nd booster for people over 50  Another COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is available for Americans after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  greenlit a fourth dose for those aged 50 and older Tuesday. It comes after Pfizer-BioNTech requested the FDA authorize a fourth dose for Americans aged 65 and older earlier this month and Moderna asked the same, but for those aged 18 and older. Several other countries have already begun administering a second booster, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends immunocompromised Americans receive a fourth dose. Two officials familiar with the matter told ABC News before the announcement that the fourth shots will be offered and not formally recommended. Experts suggest U.S. health officials wanted another booster authorized for the rest of the population before the next potential COVID-19 wave. ""This is an attempt to be sort of ahead of what might happen in the future,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. ""We will likely have another surge, whether sooner or later we don't quite know, but there is a recognition that, over time, immunity wanes."" He added, ""And booster protection is at least helpful for those older and with underlying conditions."" What is the data behind recommending a fourth dose? Several countries, including Israel, Chile and Sweden, have begun offering fourth COVID-19 doses to older adults and other at-risk groups. However, very few studies have been released exploring the benefits of a fourth dose. All are from Israel. One study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at 274 health care workers who received a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine four months after their first shot. The team found a fourth shot boosted antibody levels comparable to those seen after a third dose but did not boost protection against infection. There were no hospitalizations in either the single-boosted group or double-boosted group. Another study, which was published Thursday and has not yet been peer-reviewed, looked at more than 563,000 patients between 60 and 100 years old. Over the study period, about 58% of the group received a second booster dose. They found that participants who received a second booster dose were less likely to die within 40 days of vaccination, after adjusting for baseline health status and other factors. ""The second study was the one that made everyone pay attention … that sort of changed the discussion [about recommending a fourth dose], I think,"" Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told ABC News. ""But if you look at a percentage, that's kind of still very low. So basically, getting a booster in that population results in low mortality just overall."" Brownstein said the data is limited and should be interpreted with caution, but added that Israel has been a harbinger of what's to come in the U.S. ""Israel has already been a reasonably good indicator of what we might see in the U.S., both the impact of COVID and the efficacy of vaccines,"" he said. ""I think that provides some support with those who want to get that additional shot."" Should I get a fourth dose if I'm above age 50? Although there have not been specific studies looking at the risk of COVID-19 infection or complications in those aged 50 and older who have been doubled boosted compared to those aged 49 and younger, other studies have shown that overall protection declines in older populations. ""It might seem arbitrary, but data suggests that after age 50, your ability to fight infection decreases,"" Brownstein said. ""The number of underlying chronic conditions increases with age, too."" But experts said there is no current evidence to suggest that young, healthy Americans need a fourth vaccine dose. Chin-Hong pointed to recent CDC data, which, as of Jan. 29, showed the rate of COVID deaths among those aged 18 to 49 was 0.8 per 100,000 for the unvaccinated, 0.13 for those fully vaccinated and 0.10 for those vaccinated and boosted. ""The benefit of just being vaccinated is really the discussion rather than how many boosters you got,"" he said. What if I've had omicron recently? Chin-Hong said he doesn't think boosted Americans who were infected with omicron during the most recent wave need to get a fourth shot. He added that a COVID-19 infection will likely have boosted antibody levels high enough that a fourth shot won't add much protection. ""For these people, when you get an infection, it's almost like getting a shot itself,"" he said. ""You can consider it as your own booster shot and that hybrid immunity will generally be thought of as being very powerful."" Chin-Hong added, ""You can run out and get the shot any time if you're eligible but, in terms of biological need, it's probably less important, particularly if you've gotten a recent breakthrough infection.""

"Poland’s government has decided to block imports of coal from Russia New peace talks show signs of progress between Ukraine and Russia  WARSAW, Poland -- Poland's government decided Tuesday to block imports of coal from Russia, part of an overarching strategy to reduce energy dependence on Russia that gained new urgency after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Poland will impose financial penalties on any private entities importing Russian coal into Poland, with Polish customs officials carrying out checks, government spokesman Piotr Mueller said as he announced the new policy. He added that Poland could no longer wait for the whole 27-nation European Union to embrace the policy. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EU, the United States and some other powers imposed a range of economic sanctions on Russia. But Europe has historically been dependent on Russian energy sources — primarily oil and gas but also coal to some extent — and has had trouble weaning itself off. Poland, which was under Moscow's influence during the communist era, has worked in recent years to reduce its use of Russian energy sources, and will soon no longer have to rely on Russian gas. It is more dependent on Russian oil, however. And while Poland produces much of its own coal, it also relies on imports. Russian coal makes up 13% of the fuel used each year, according to Piotr Lewandowski, the president of the Institute for Structural Research in Warsaw. Half of that imported Russian coal is used to generate heat in individual homes, while the rest is used for district heating or industry, he said. “That’s why it’s much easier to ban coal in the final week of March than in October,” Lewandowski said. “The question now is how do you prepare for the next heating season?” One option will be to buy coal from other sources, but that might be more expensive, given Russian coal's favorable quality-to-price ratio. The other is for Poland's government to create more incentives for households to retrofit their homes in order to generate power from other energy sources, such as heat pumps, Lewandowski said. Polish coal miners will certainly welcome the move because they felt that importing coal from Russia and other countries undermined their own declining industry. Many critics of the Poland's conservative government have also argued that it was wrong to keep importing Russian coal while Poland criticized Germany and other countries for their increasing dependence on Russian energy sources. Even before the war began, Russian coal was problematic because a certain portion of it was extracted from the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Russian-backed insurgents were fighting against the Ukrainian military. The coal was perceived as a theft of Ukrainian resources, sent to Russia for export abroad. ——— Follow all AP stories on developments related to the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/russia-ukraine.",2
"In what appeared to be a coordinated action to tackle Russian espionage, at least four European allies say they are expelling dozens of Russian diplomats New round of peace talks begin between Russia, Ukraine THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- In what appeared to be a coordinated action to tackle Russian espionage, at least four European allies expelled dozens of Russian diplomats on Tuesday. The expulsions come as relations between Russia and the West have plunged into a deep freeze following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The Netherlands said it was expelling 17 Russians who it described as intelligence officers masquerading as diplomats. Belgium said it was ejecting 21 Russians. The Czech Republic gave one Russian diplomat 72 hours to leave the country. Ireland told four senior Russian officials to leave the country because of activities deemed not “in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour."" North Macedonia announced late Monday it is expelling five Russian diplomats for “activities contrary to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."" “Together with our allies, we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU,” the Czech Foreign Ministry said. Poland last week expelled 45 Russians whom the government identified as intelligence officers using their diplomatic status as cover to operate in the country. The Netherlands said it took its decision in consultation with “a number of like-minded countries,” citing similar expulsions by the United States, Poland, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Montenegro. “The cabinet has decided to do this because of the threat to national security posed by this group,” the Dutch ministry said in a statement. “The intelligence threat against the Netherlands remains high. The current attitude of Russia in a broader sense makes the presence of these intelligence officers undesirable. The deportation is a measure taken in the context of national security.” Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said he was prepared for a retaliation from Moscow. “Experience shows that Russia does not leave these kinds of measures unanswered,"" he said. ""We cannot speculate about that, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for various scenarios that may arise in the near future.” That was demonstrated earlier Tuesday, when Russia said it expelled a total of 10 diplomats from the three Baltic EU states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in retaliation for those countries expelling Russian diplomats earlier this month. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was cancelling the accreditation of four Lithuanian diplomats, three Latvians and three Estonians and they would be required to leave the country. That corresponds to the number of Russian diplomats each country previously expelled. On March 18, the three Baltic countries ordered the expulsion of 10 Russian embassy staff members in a coordinated action taken in solidarity with Ukraine. Moscow called that move “provocative and entirely baseless” and that it had summoned the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian ambassadors in Moscow for an official protest. ——— Follow all AP stories on Russia's war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",3
"Shots could be administered within hours. FDA approves 2nd COVID-19 booster shot for some A second round of booster shots was greenlighted for everyone over the age of 50 by public health officials on Tuesday, kicking off the regulatory process for shots to likely be available in pharmacies this week. Everyone 12 and older is already eligible for a booster shot five months after their initial vaccine series if they received an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer or Moderna, or two months after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. But for those over 50, determined to be a vulnerable age group, officials at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have decided the data on waning immunity justifies making another shot available four months after the first boost. And while anyone who meets that criteria can now get another booster, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said it was ""especially important"" for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions. ""This is especially important for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe disease from COVID-19 as they are the most likely to benefit from receiving an additional booster dose at this time,"" Walensky said in a statement on Tuesday. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told reporters in a briefing about the decision that he would urge his own family members to heed the latest advice. ""If it were my relatives, I would be sending them out to do this again,"" he said. ""Because after all, COVID-19 has had a really disproportional adverse effect on people 65 years of age and older and those with comorbidities."" Marks said officials decided on the age range of 50 and up because about one-third of people between 50 and 65 have significant comorbidities. ""By choosing age 50 and up ... we felt like we would capture the population that might most benefit from this fourth booster dose,"" Marks said. But he also sought to emphasize that the additional booster shouldn't dissuade people from getting their initial booster, which half of eligible people have yet to do. ""Just to reiterate, the good news is that for most people who have been vaccinated and had one booster, their original booster shot is continuing to provide you with good protection from being hospitalized or dying,"" he said. So far, there is limited U.S. data on second boosters. But data from Israel indicates that an additional booster shot can provide a temporary bump in protection, reducing the risk of dying for adults over 60. Several countries, including Israel, Chile and Sweden, have begun offering fourth COVID-19 doses to older adults and other at-risk groups. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the White House, has said he expects additional boosters would ""reconstitute"" people back to the maximal level of antibodies, rather than boost people higher than their previous immune responses from any of the earlier shots. But he said the body's B cell and T cell response, which have more impact on the duration of immunity, may incrementally be increased with each additional boost. And while Tuesday's announcement only applies to older Americans, a decision for the rest of the population is coming soon. The FDA will convene a panel of vaccine experts on April 6 to discuss the plan. They will talk about the efficacy of booster shots and the potential need for a variant-specific booster instead of continual booster shots designed for the initial strain of COVID-19. A decision would likely be made later this summer or fall. For now, the feeling is that there is ample time to make that decision because boosters continue to show good protection among younger people. It would also be months before a variant-specific booster is available. ""There's reasonable evidence right now that, in younger individuals, the protection against the serious outcomes of hospitalization and death is being maintained, and although it may be dropping off a little bit, it's not dropping off in a very significant way,"" Marks said. ""So the feeling was, right now, to take this action for those most at risk, and obviously we'll continue to evaluate the data."" But boosting too frequently could cause fatigue, a dilemma many public health experts are weighing especially because anyone who gets a booster shot now would likely need to get another in the summer or fall if a variant-specific, more effective shot is available. ""We're going to have to learn to live with mild disease at some point,"" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC News. Frequent boosting ""is not a reasonable thing to do, and it's not something most people will do anyway."" Pfizer's CEO Albert Bourla has also acknowledged the impracticality of people rigorously staying up to date with shots every few months. ""We can't have vaccines every five, six months,"" said Bourla, speaking on CNBC. But until new-and-improved boosters are ready to go, Pfizer and Moderna executives argue fourth doses will be needed by at least some older Americans soon. Still, the vast majority of Americans have yet to get even a first booster shot. Of the nearly 90 million fully vaccinated Americans, about half got their shots more than five months ago but still haven't gotten a booster shot. About two-thirds of seniors have gotten their first booster shot. ABC's Aaron Katersky reports:",3
"Russia is demanding payment in rubles for its natural gas exports to Europe On Location: March 31, 2022 BERLIN -- Europe's already high gas prices have gyrated since Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to have importers pay for Russian natural gas in rubles instead of dollars and euros. Here's a look at some of the implications of such a move: WHAT IS PUTIN PROPOSING? Europe imports large amounts of Russian natural gas to heat homes, generate electricity and fuel industry, and those imports have continued despite the war in Ukraine. Around 60% of imports are paid in euros, and the rest in dollars. Putin wants to change that by requiring foreign gas importers to purchase rubles and use them to pay state-owned supplier Gazprom. Putin told the Russian central bank last Wednesday to come up with a workable system. WHAT EFFECTS COULD THAT PLAN HAVE? Importers would have to find a bank that would exchange euros and dollars for rubles. That could be cumbersome because some Russian banks have been either blocked or cut off from the SWIFT messaging system that facilitates international payments. Still, there are some banks that haven't been cut off, and for now, sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury barring bank transactions contain exceptions for energy payments. That's a concession to European allies that are much more reliant on Russian oil and gas and fear a total cutoff could throw their economy into recession. Russia getting paid for gas in their currency would at best help marginally in getting around financial sanctions, propping up the ruble’s value or protecting the Russian economy, said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a former official at the International Monetary Fund. “Either Putin is getting terrible economic advice or he is going further off the rails in his hatred for the West,” Prasad said. “It would be cheaper for foreign importers to pay for Russia’s exports in a currency that is collapsing in value, but it is difficult to acquire rubles and make payments in a manner that avoids the sanctions."" He warned that the move “could further roil global energy markets by exacerbating current supply disruptions and adding to uncertainty about future supplies, which could all add up to more price spikes.” HOW IS PUTIN'S DEMAND BEING RECEIVED IN EUROPE? European governments and energy companies are rejecting the idea, saying gas import contracts specify the currency and that one side can't change it overnight. They say they intend to keep paying in euros and dollars. More broadly, the Group of Seven major economies including Japan, the U.S. and Canada as well as Germany, France, Italy and Britain have agreed to reject Moscow’s demand. The European Union's energy commissioner also agreed, a G-7 statement said. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck told reporters Monday that “all G-7 ministers agreed completely"" that such a step would be ""a one-sided and clear breach of the existing contracts.” WHAT’S PUTIN’S MOTIVE? In theory, requiring ruble payments could support demand for the currency and its exchange rate. But not by much, Prasad says. As it stands, euros and dollars are already being used to purchase rubles when Gazprom exchanges its foreign earnings. The Center for Eastern Studies in Warsaw has suggested that by moving the flow of foreign currency from Gazprom to the largely state-controlled banking system, the Kremlin will gain added control over foreign currency that has become scarcer since Western countries froze much of Russia's reserves abroad. However, that would leave Gazprom without hard currency to make foreign debt payments or purchase supplies abroad. As it stands, the gas supplier already has to sell 80% of its foreign currency to Russia's central bank. The ruble dispute has raised concerns it could lead to an interruption in natural gas supply. That could open Russia to charges of not adhering to long-term energy contracts, which it has done so far. Europe's pipeline system is highly connected, so any attempt to restrict flows to some countries would affect the others, according to analysts at Rystad Energy. Beyond that, energy sales are a key source of revenue for Russia. Asked by reporters if Russia could cut gas supplies to European customers if they reject the demand to pay in rubles, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call Monday that “we clearly aren’t going to supply gas for free.” “In our situation, it’s hardly possible and feasible to engage in charity for Europe,” Peskov said. HOW REAL IS THAT THREAT? The ruble proposal led Germany’s utilities association, the BDEW, to call on the government to declare an “early warning” of a severe energy shortage. That’s the first of three stages of energy emergency in EU and German law, the highest being a shortage so severe that the government must shut off gas to industry to protect households. The German government does not see the need for such a declaration, a spokeswoman said Monday. It's possible Putin is bluffing. This month, Russia threatened to use rubles to pay foreign investors who hold government bonds dominated in dollars. It went through with a dollar payment after ratings agencies said paying in rubles would put Russia in default. When it comes to gas payments, “Putin may demand rubles, but the contracts are clear,"" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""His only option to force change is to refuse to deliver products, and that cannot happen: He can’t keep oil and gas from coming out of the ground without capping wells, and storage capacity will get filled very fast if shipments stop cold. ” “So let’s call it a bluff,” Weinberg said. “Russia cannot stop shipping product any more than Germany and the EU can stop buying it.” WHY IS ENERGY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE WAR? The European economy remains heavily dependent on Russia for 40% of its gas imports and 25% of its oil. While the U.S. and the United Kingdom have said they will stop buying Russian oil, European leaders have shied away from a total boycott of Russian oil and gas. Instead, they have focused on reducing their imports over the next several years through conservation, other sources and switching to wind and solar as fast as they can. Estimates vary of the impact of a total gas shutoff in Europe, but they generally involve a substantial loss of economic output.",6
"A NASA astronaut is back on Earth after a yearlong, record-setting spaceflight A NASA astronaut caught a Russian ride back to Earth on Wednesday after a U.S. record 355 days at the International Space Station, returning with two cosmonauts to a world torn apart by war. Mark Vande Hei landed in a Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan alongside the Russian Space Agency’s Pyotr Dubrov, who also spent the past year in space, and Anton Shkaplerov. Wind blew the capsule onto its side following touchdown, and the trio emerged into the late afternoon sun one by one. Vande Hei, the last one out, grinned and waved as he was carried to a reclining chair out in the open Kazakh steppes. “Beautiful out here,” said Vande Hei, putting on a face mask and ballcap. Despite escalating tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Vladimir Putin’s war with Ukraine, Vande Hei’s return followed customary procedures. A small NASA team of doctors and other staff was on hand for the touchdown and planned to return immediately to Houston with the 55-year-old astronaut. Even before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Vande Hei said he was avoiding the subject with his two Russian crewmates. Despite getting along “fantastically ... I’m not sure we really want to go there,"" he said. It was the first taste of gravity for Vande Hei and Dubrov since their Soyuz launch on April 9 last year. Shkaplerov joined them at the orbiting lab in October, escorting a Russian film crew up for a brief stay. To accommodate that visit, Vande Hei and Dubrov doubled the length of their stay. Before departing the space station, Shkaplerov embraced his fellow astronauts as “my space brothers and space sister.” “People have problem on Earth. On orbit ... we are one crew,” Shkaplerov said in a live NASA TV broadcast Tuesday. The space station is a symbol of “friendship and cooperation and ... future of exploration of space.” The war tensions bubbled over in other areas of space with the suspension of European satellite launches on Russian rockets and the Europe-Russia Mars rover stuck on Earth for another two years. Vande Hei surpassed NASA’s previous record for the longest single spaceflight by 15 days. Dubrov moved into Russia’s top five, well short of the 437-day, 17-hour marathon by a cosmonaut-physician aboard the 1990s Mir space station that remains the world record. “Broken records mean we’re making progress,” said NASA’s previous space endurance champ, retired astronaut Scott Kelly, whose 340-day mission ended in 2016. Like Kelly, Vande Hei underwent medical testing during his long stay to further NASA’s quest to get astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars. He said daily meditation helped him cope during the mission, twice as long as his first station stint four years earlier. “I’ve had an indoor job 24-7 for almost a year so I am looking forward to being outside no matter what kind of weather,” Vande Hei said in a recent series of NASA videos. As for food, he’s looking forward to making a cup of coffee for himself and wife Julie, and digging into guacamole and chips. Remaining on board: Three Russians who arrived two weeks ago and three Americans and one German, who have been aboard since November. Their replacements are due in three weeks via SpaceX. Next week, SpaceX will fly three rich businessmen and their ex-astronaut escort to the station for a weeklong visit arranged by the private Axiom Space. Elon Musk’s SpaceX began transporting NASA astronauts to the station in 2020, nine years after the shuttle program ended. During that gap, Russia offered the lone taxi service, with NASA shelling out tens of millions of dollars per Soyuz seat. Vande Hei's ride was part of a barter exchange with Houston-based Axiom. ——— The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"The pledge gives President Joe Biden's nominee her first GOP vote. Sen. Susan Collins set to vote to confirm Judge Jackson to Supreme Court Sen. Susan Collins of Maine plans to support the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, the nominee's first GOP supporter. ""After reviewing Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's extensive record, watching much of her hearing testimony, and meeting with her twice in person, I have concluded that she possesses the experience, qualifications, and integrity to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. I will, therefore, vote to confirm her to this position,"" Collins, a moderate Republican often seen as a swing vote for judicial nominations, said in a statement on Wednesday. Collins met for a second time with Jackson on Tuesday night, and after more than an hour behind closed doors, the senator emerged calling the meeting ""useful and productive,"" adding that Jackson ""provided clarification on some of the issues,"" and indicating that some of those included the judge's sentencing of child porn offenders and her representation -- as a federal public defender -- of Guantanamo Bay detainees. ""In my meetings with Judge Jackson, we discussed in depth several issues that were raised in her hearing. Sometimes I agreed with her; sometimes I did not,"" continued Collins. ""And just as I have disagreed with some of her decisions to date, I have no doubt that, if Judge Jackson is confirmed, I will not agree with every vote that she casts as a Justice. That alone, however, is not disqualifying."" The announcement Wednesday was a crucial win for President Joe Biden, who set a goal from the outset of securing bipartisan support for his nominee, who would be the first Black woman to take a seat on the high court. The New York Times was the first to report the development. Some Republicans, at the more than 23 hours of hearings last week, took issue with the nominee accusing President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld of ""war crimes"" as she challenged in a legal brief the detention of some terrorism suspects post-Sept. 11, but Jackson said at the time she was naming the two men in their official capacity, not personally. Later, in similar detention challenges, those documents would bear the name of President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Republicans, led by Sen Josh Hawley, R-Mo., also challenged Jackson's sentencing of child porn offenders in some of the most explosive allegations of the proceedings. A handful of offenders received sentences below federal guidelines from Jackson, but the prison terms were above those recommended by the probation officer, putting her in the mainstream of judicial action. One case, in particular, though, saw a Jackson sentence below that recommended by the probation officer. The White House team working on Jackson's nomination has indicated they hope to secure the support of more Republicans, but senior GOP aides have indicated they would be surprised if that support was more than the judge received for her past nominations. Collins supported Jackson more recently for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. But this time around, it does not appear Jackson will get Graham's support, though the senator has said he will announce a final decision soon. The South Carolina Republican -- a senior member of the Judiciary Committee -- took issue with her over the ""war crimes"" designation, saying that was ""a bridge too far"" for him. He also laid into Jackson, in one fiery exchange, for not ""throwing the book"" at child pornography offenders. Murkowski on Tuesday said she was more focused on the services honoring her late-Alaska colleague, Rep. Don Young. Murkowski also supported Jackson for the appeals court. And all eyes are on Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who sat down with Jackson on Tuesday for an hour-long conversation. Though he was seen as a possible Republican supporter, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced Wednesday that he intends to vote against Jackson's confirmation. He noted the historic nature of her nomination and said he was ""impressed"" with her knowledge and composure during the hearings -- but he noted that he ""still hold(s) my initial concerns that she may legislate from the bench instead of consistently following the Constitution as written."" ""I am also disappointed that she is reluctant to take a firm public stand against a liberal, dark money court-packing scheme that represents a fundamental threat to the independence of the federal judiciary, even though other justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have done so,"" Tillis said in a statement. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, also on the Judiciary panel, has yet to announce how he will vote and has said he is still reviewing the hearings and support material. The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on the nomination Monday morning, putting Jackson on track to be confirmed by the end of next week. If she does not get the support of Grassley and deadlocks in committee, Democratic leadership can move to force the nomination out of committee and still get to a full Senate confirmation vote by week's end.",6
"Republican Senate candidates will take the stage in Pennsylvania Wednesday. What is the difference between a primary and a caucus? The TAKE with Rick Klein It turns out Republicans don't need former President Donald Trump to make their intraparty fights nasty - and that's not even counting what Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., is saying about his colleagues' after-hour activities. Midway through a busy forum-and-debate season in primaries, it's striking how personal and ugly some of the highest-profile races have gotten in contests for the Republican nomination. The leading Republican Senate candidates in Pennsylvania will all share a stage for the first time Wednesday morning at a candidate forum. Already in that race, David McCormick’s campaign has accused Dr. Mehmet Oz of harboring ""dual loyalties"" because Oz has maintained Turkish citizenship. For his part, Oz is airing a campaign ad asserting that McCormick is ""China's friend"" who made money on Chinese investments after ""China sent us COVID."" Over in Ohio, two GOP Senate candidates bumped chests and almost came to blows over foreign investments and credentials in the private sector at a recent debate. In the governor's race, the main Republican challenger to Gov. Mike DeWine has said the governor of his own party has inflicted ""misery"" on Ohioans and is the ""biggest RINO in America today."" That term – short for ""Republican in name only"" – is also coursing through a House primary in West Virginia where two GOP incumbents are running against each other because of redistricting. One candidate is calling his rival a ""RINO"" who likes to work with President Joe Biden; the target of that attack has labeled his colleague a ""political prostitute,"" citing his previous runs for office in other states. Trump himself has poured fuel on intra-party fights of late. He revoked an endorsement in Alabama just last week, and used a weekend trip to Georgia to refresh attacks on incumbent Republicans who didn't back up his lies about the 2020 election. The political environment may be such that Republicans win big this fall even while scorching each other during the primaries. For now, though, GOP candidates are spending time and money elevating issues that are likely to live through November in attack ads. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., joined the chorus of progressive lawmakers calling for Justice Clarence Thomas to resign. It comes amid continued fallout from the discovery of text messages from  Thomas' wife, Ginni Thomas, to former president Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to overturn the election in the lead up to Jan. 6. ""Clarence Thomas should resign. If not, his failure to disclose income from right-wing organizations, recuse himself from matters involving his wife, and his vote to block the Jan 6th commission from key information must be investigated and could serve as grounds for impeachment,"" she wrote in a tweet. Ocasio-Cortez joins lawmakers including Reps. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, and Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who have called for resignation. Some lawmakers, like Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. have called on Thomas to recuse himself, citing a conflict of interest. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to launch an investigation. If Thomas doesn't bow to the pressure and recuse himself from Jan. 6-related cases, the other recourse is impeachment, which is highly unlikely. Impeachment of a Supreme Court Justice, even if there were an appetite for it, is rare. Only one has been impeached, Justice Samuel Chase in 1804. He was ultimately acquitted. Thus far, Republicans have backed Thomas. ""Justice Thomas is a great American and an outstanding Justice,"" Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell said in a statement Friday. ""I have total confidence in his brilliance and impartiality in every aspect of the work of the Court."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema  Redistricting fallout continues to take a front seat in several states' primary calendars by creating legal hurdles and raising the stakes for parties' prospects in November. In Ohio -- where early voting for primary elections begins next week -- the state Supreme Court decided Tuesday it would not rule on a case challenging the state's current congressional district maps that heavily favor Republicans and which voting rights groups say are gerrymandered. The parties involved in the lawsuit now have nearly a month to provide evidence and written arguments, leaving a broader window for the court to give its decision, which could overlap with the May 3 primary election. For now, the state has not altered its election calendar in anticipation of issues stemming from the ongoing redistricting battle. Meanwhile in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis broke with the GOP-led legislature by vetoing congressional maps backed by state lawmakers of his own party. DeSantis also called for a special April legislative session to draw new maps. Although it is unlikely Florida's election calendar could be thrown off over the current state of the redistricting process given its August primary date, the lingering questions about what areas district borders end up covering could still hinder candidates' campaigning abilities. The move was expected, given the governor previously said he would reject the proposal while favoring his own version of the maps, which would give Republicans an even stronger political advantage. However, the map that ultimately is created during the upcoming special session is also likely to face challenges in court. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight  41.  That’s the percentage of Americans who approve of President Biden’s job performance, near his all-time low according to FiveThirtyEight’s real-time average of public opinion polls. Biden's approval ratings, which had been north of 50 percent during his first 200 days in office, began to steadily decline in the summer of 2021, reaching the low 40s by the end of last year. Then, in late February and into March, his numbers improved a smidge – the share of Americans saying they approved of his performance ticked up from about 41 percent to 43 percent, and the share saying they disapproved fell from just over 53 percent to roughly 51 percent. That's not a big change, of course. But it was significant given how polarized American politics have grown, and it raised at least the possibility that Biden could turn the trends around. Not so much, it turns out. Over the last two weeks, Biden's small gains have disappeared. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

"Mark Vande Hei completed the longest spaceflight by an American astronaut. NASA astronaut breaks record for longest US spaceflight NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei returned to Earth Wednesday, after spending a record-breaking 355 days in low-Earth orbit. Vande Hei shared a spacecraft with two Russian cosmonauts as tensions between the Russia and the U.S. continue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Vande Hei returned in a Soyuz spacecraft with Russian cosmonauts Pyotr Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov, making a parachute-assisted landing at 7:28 a.m. in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. The trio had departed the International Space Station at 3:21 a.m. ET. Vande Hei broke the record for the longest spaceflight by a NASA astronaut by 15 days. The record was previously held by retired astronaut Scott Kelly. On this spaceflight, Vande Hei completed 5,680 orbits of the Earth and a journey of more than 150 million miles, roughly the equivalent of 312 trips to the Moon and back, according to NASA. This trip gave Vande Hei a lifetime total of 523 days in space. ""Mark's mission is not only record-breaking, but also paving the way for future human explorers on the Moon, Mars, and beyond,"" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a press release. ""Our astronauts make incredible sacrifices in the name of science, exploration, and cutting-edge technology development, not least among them time away from loved ones."" Nelson added: ""NASA and the nation are proud to welcome Mark home and grateful for his incredible contributions throughout his year-long stay on the International Space Station."" According to NASA, Vande Hei contributed to dozens of studies from the hundreds executed during his mission, including six science investigations supported by NASA’s Human Research Program. As NASA plans to return to the Moon, under the Artemis program, and prepares for the exploration of Mars, the agency said Vande Hei's extended mission will provide researchers the opportunity to observe the effects of long-duration spaceflight on humans. After the crew goes through post-landing medical checks, they will be flown to the recovery staging city in Karaganda, Kazakhstan, on Russian helicopters. Vande Hei will then board a NASA plane to Cologne, Germany, for refueling, prior to his return home. Shkaplerov and Dubrov will be flown home to Star City, Russia, on a Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center aircraft. ABC’s Jim Ryan reports:",3
"The president gives remarks Wednesday afternoon about the state of the pandemic. Pres. Biden gives COVID-19 remarks, gets 2nd booster: ABC News Live President Joe Biden will receive his second booster shot following his scheduled remarks Wednesday about the state of the country's COVID response, according to the White House. Biden's speech to to promote the launch of COVID.gov, a new website the White House is billing as a ""one-stop shop"" to help Americans get better access to vaccines, tests, treatments and masks -- as well as area-specific updates on COVID-19 spread. The website leads users to locations where they can get vaccines, boosters and masks, and it connects people with another White House website to order free at-home rapid tests. The president is also highlighting that the ""Test to Treat"" initiative he announced at the State of the Union has already expanded to over 2,000 sites nationwide and now through COVID.gov's new ""Test to Treat Locator,"" Americans can readily find pharmacies and community health centers to get tested for COVID-19 and receive treatments if needed. Notably, many of the COVID response efforts available on COVID.gov are the same things the White House says are in jeopardy of running out in the coming weeks and months if more funding is not approved. Administration officials for weeks have been ringing alarm bells about the critical need for more COVID funding, warning of the severe consequences for Americans. Biden on Wednesday is sending what a White House official called an ""urgent, direct message to Congress"" to act swiftly to secure funding for the administration's COVID response. Last week, the fund to cover testing and treatment for uninsured Americans ran out of money, leaving people to pay as much as $125 out of pocket if they get PCR testing at labs like Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest in the country. The funding to cover the cost of administering vaccines for uninsured people will run out next week. At the same time, monoclonal antibody treatment supplies distributed to states each week has been cut by 35%. And the U.S. supply could run out entirely by May if funding isn't secured. The government says it has enough tests to get to the summer, but if there's another surge, the country will again be caught flat-footed like it was during the omicron wave. ""You could see, again, a gap in access to at-home testing,"" Andrea Palm, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, told reporters last week. The White House has said without additional funding, ""the results are dire"" -- one official told ABC News earlier this month, ""Simply put, failing to take action now will have severe consequences for the American people."" The White House has asked for $22.5 billion in immediate aid to keep COVID-19 programs afloat. Congress whittled that request down to $15 billion before cutting it from a spending bill entirely in early March. Since then, the White House has urged Democrats and Republicans on the Hill to come to an agreement, but negotiations remain at a stalemate. ABC News' Justin Gomez contributed to this report.",6
"A malicious software command that crippled tens of thousands of modems across Europe anchored the cyberattack on a satellite network used by Ukraine’s government and military just as Russia invaded On Location: March 31, 2022 A malicious software command that immediately crippled tens of thousands of modems across Europe anchored the cyberattack on a satellite network used by Ukraine’s government and military just as Russia invaded, the satellite owner disclosed Wednesday. The owner, U.S.-based Viasat, issued a statement providing details for the first time of how the most serious known cyberattack of the Russia-Ukraine war unfolded. The wide-ranging attack affected users from Poland to France, getting quick notice by knocking off remote access to thousands of wind turbines in central Europe. Viasat would not say who it believed was responsible for the attack when asked separately by The Associated Press. Ukrainian officials blame Russian hackers. The Viasat attack, coming just as Russia was launching its invasion, was considered at the time by many a harbinger of serious cyberattacks that could extend beyond Ukraine. Such attacks haven’t yet materialized, though security researchers say the most impactful war-related cyber operations are likely occurring in the shadows, focused on intelligence-gathering. A free-for-all of lesser attacks, many apparently carried out by volunteers, have been launched against both Russia and Ukraine. A persistent drumbeat of malicious hacking that Ukrainian officials and cybersecurity researchers blame on Russia-affiliated attackers has plagued Ukraine throughout the more than month-long conflict. One of the most serious hacks largely knocked offline the internet and cellular service of a major telecommunications company that serves the military, Ukrtelecom, for most of Monday. On Wednesday, Google said it had identified a state-backed Russian hacking group engaged in a credential-phishing campaign targeting the militaries of multiple Eastern European countries and a NATO think tank. It said it did not know if any of the targets were successfully compromised. The attack on the KA-SAT satellite network highlighted how vulnerable commercial satellite networks that serve both military and non-military clients can be, with the impact felt by individuals and businesses far from the battlefield. It began in the early hours of Feb. 24 with a distributed denial-of-service onslaught that knocked a large number of modems offline. A destructive attack followed in which a malicious software command sent across the network rendered tens of thousands of modems across Europe inoperable by overwriting key data in their internal memory, Viasat said. “We believe the purpose of the attack was to interrupt service,” it said. It said it has shipped 30,000 replacement modems to affected customers across Europe, most of whom use the service for residential broadband internet access. The attack caused a major loss in communications in Ukraine in the early hours of Russia’s invasion, top Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora told reporters earlier this month. Asked by the AP last week who was responsible, Zhora said, “We don’t need to attribute it since we have obvious evidence that it was organized by Russian hackers to disrupt connection between customers that use this satellite system.” He said he did not have information on whether the service had been restored and could not say which Ukrainian agencies beyond the military were affected. Contracts show, however, that Zhora’s own agency, the State Service for Special Communications, is among customers that also include police agencies and municipalities. Viasat said “several thousand customers"" located in Ukraine were impacted. Viasat, based in Carlsbad, California, said the initial denial of service attack had emanated from modems inside Ukraine. It did not specify how the destructive malware entered the network other than to say a “misconfiguration” in a virtual private network appliance was compromised, allowing the attackers to gain remote access from the internet to a “trusted” management console used to administer the satellite network. From there, the attackers were able to simultaneously send the disabling command to modems across Europe, rendering them useless but not permanently unusable, Viasat said. It was not known how the attackers breached the VPN appliance. Satellite cybersecurity researcher Ruben Santamarta said it was important to know whether they had obtained credentials or exploited a known vulnerability. Viasat declined to provide specifics Wednesday, citing an ongoing investigation. Gregory Falco, a Johns Hopkins University professor specializing in satellite system security, said the impact on affected systems was minor compared to what the attackers were capable of doing. Falco said it's likely they've maintained a foothold. “The attackers don’t want to show their whole hand or any of their positioning for how they plan to persist in the network,” he said. The hacked ground-based network is run by Skylogic, an Italy-based subsidiary of Eutelsat, from which Viasat purchased the KA-SAT satellite in April of last year. Viasat’s investigation of the attack was done by the U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant.",7
"Prosecutors in Michigan have rested their case against four men charged with planning to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer before the 2020 national election On Location: March 30, 2022 Prosecutors rested their case Wednesday against four men charged with planning to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer before the 2020 national election. Key evidence over 13 days of trial came from two undercover FBI agents and an informant who was among the extremists for months and made hours of secret recordings. Two men who avoided trial by pleading guilty provided critical testimony last week. One of the last witnesses for the government was the longtime companion of Barry Croft Jr., an alleged leader of the scheme. “He was antigovernment,” Chastity Knight of Bear, Delaware, told jurors in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “He just thought the government’s not for him. The government doesn’t help the people out. They like to line their own pockets.” Croft, Adam Fox, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta are charged with a kidnapping conspiracy. Fox, Croft and Harris also face additional charges related to explosives. Knight, 40, cried as she identified one of Croft’s daughters as the person who offered him a chip during a training session with weapons in Luther, Michigan. “Honey, I’m making explosives. Can you get away from me, please? ... I love you. Get out of here,” Croft said in secretly recorded remarks. Defense lawyers asked for a direct acquittal, a standard step in a criminal trial, arguing there wasn't sufficient evidence to give the case to the jury. But U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker quickly swept it aside and especially noted the detailed testimony of two star witnesses who pleaded guilty, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks. Defense teams plan to summon their own trial witnesses, and it's possible the four men will testify. Attorneys claim the group was engaged in a lot of crazy talk fueled by agents, informants and marijuana but not a conspiracy. The men were arrested in October 2020 as they moved closer to obtaining an explosive that could blow up a bridge and hold back police from responding to a kidnapping at Whitmer’s vacation home, according to trial testimony. Garbin said the men acted willingly and had hoped to create national chaos by striking before the election. He said there was a desire to stop Joe Biden from winning the presidency. The group was angry over COVID-19 restrictions and disgusted with government, recordings and social media posts show. Whitmer, a Democrat, rarely talks publicly about the kidnapping plot, though she referred to “surprises” during her term that seem like “something out of fiction” when she filed for reelection on March 17. She has blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case. Whitmer has said Trump was complicit in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. ——— Find AP’s full coverage of the Whitmer kidnap plot trial at: https://apnews.com/hub/whitmer-kidnap-plot-trial ——— White reported from Detroit.",6
"Reed has been detained in Russia since the summer of 2019. Family of former US Marine detained in Russia: ‘We’re desperate’ The parents of Trevor Reed, a 30-year-old U.S. citizen and former Marine currently who has been imprisoned in Russia since 2019, demonstrated outside the White House on Wednesday to urge President Joe Biden to do more to bring their son home amid Russia's violent invasion of Ukraine. When asked by ABC News what they would say to Biden, Joey and Paula Reed said they wanted to remind him of their son's service to the county and to him personally, highlighting his experience as a presidential guard at Camp David. ""We want to tell him about our son -- a little bit that he hasn't gotten from a report from someone. Remind him that our son added time to his Marine Corps service so he could be a presidential guard,"" Joey Reed said. The parents' pleas come as the State Department announced a new advisory Wednesday warning Americans not to travel to Russia or Ukraine and making it explicit that U.S. citizens in Russia could be singled out ""including for detention."" Trevor Reed has been imprisoned for 956 days and is on the third day of his second hunger strike in the last six months in a prison in Mordovia, Russia, his parents say. Reed suspects he has tuberculosis and a broken rib but has not received ""meaningful medical care,"" they said, so they staged a protest outside the White House to raise awareness about his case. They said he spends most of his days in solitary confinement, constantly getting punished for mundane things like not making his bed properly. ""During the day because the room has no real heating and there's cracks in the windows you see your breath all day long. He coils up on the floor next to a hot water pipe to stay warm and then he's given violations for laying on the floor during the daytime,"" his father told reporters. The Reeds repeatedly told reporters that they want a prisoner swap in exchange for their son. ""Our son was willing to give his life for President Biden and his family. And so it's not just that he served his country, he served this president in particular. And not that all of the Americans that are held around the world shouldn't get everything that our government can give -- if that means prisoner trades then so be it, let's get our Americans home,"" he said. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since the summer of 2019 and was sentenced in 2020 to nine years in a Russian prison colony, convicted on charges of violently assaulting two police officers in Moscow following a drunken party in Moscow where he was visiting his girlfriend. Reed's family and U.S. officials say those charges and ones brought for former Marine Paul Whelan, also being detained in Russia, were fabricated in order to seize them as bargaining chips. When Biden was in Reed's home state of Texas earlier this month, his motorcade drove past Reed's parents as they demonstrated a speech he was giving in Fort Worth about helping veterans. Biden called an hour later to apologize for not stopping and promised to meet them in person, according to the White House. ""After his event in Fort Worth, the President called Joey and Paula Reed to reiterate his commitment to doing everything he can to bring their son home, to staying in close touch with them through his national security team, and to finding a time to meet in person,"" a White House official said on March 8. But in the 22 days since that phone call, the Reed family says they have not received any follow-up from a Biden official. The White House had not responded to repeated questions from ABC News since Thursday about why it hasn't yet reached out to Reed's parents until it provided a statement about an hour before the Reeds planned to speak with reporters outside the White House. ""The president cannot imagine the pain the Reed family is going through every day,"" a senior Biden administration official said in a statement. ""The president is committed to bringing Trevor and every American unjustly detained overseas home. It is the State Department's highest priority."" Asked after prepared COVID-related remarks Wednesday whether he would see Reed's parents while they were in Washington, Biden said: ""I'm gonna see if I can get to see them. They're good people."" Pressed on whether that meant he would see them Wednesday, Biden said, ""We're trying to work that out."" ""Each day, we worry that our son will become the next Otto Warmbier,"" the Reed parents said in a statement, referring to an American student who died after detainment in North Korea. ""We hope the President will be able to find the time to see us. We need his Administration to stop deliberating and start acting. We believe the President (whom we voted for) is the only person who can save our son's life."" The Reeds have also used the moment to raise awareness about other Americans detained in Russia, including WNBA star Brittney Griner and Whelan, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in what the U.S. ambassador to Russia called a ""mockery of justice."" ""The time is now to bring home Trevor, Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. As we have said for more than a year, we continue to worry escalating tensions, or rhetoric, could lead to Russian authorities inventing additional false charges against Trevor,"" they said in the statement. Trevor's parents' said they had asked their son, in one of the few times they've been able to speak since his imprisonment, what he would tell the president -- but said he had nothing to say. ""I think that he's forgotten about me,"" Reed allegedly said. ABC News asked Joey if he thought Biden's comment that seemed to imply he wanted a regime change in Russia hurt their chances of getting their son home. ""You'd have to ask Putin,"" he said. ""We believe that -- the comments about Putin -- we don't want to comment on them but obviously they're not helpful. But I guess they speak for themselves,"" he added. They said they plan to stay in Washington through Friday. ABC News' Patrick Reevell and Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",6
"Committee members hope to begin public hearings in May. Capitol insurrection: Tracking the attack 1 year later The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack is facing a time crunch as investigators scramble to piece together former President Donald Trump's words and actions on Jan. 6, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., acknowledged Tuesday. ""We're playing 'beat the clock' here against Trump's inner coterie, which thinks they can impede our investigation,"" Raskin told reporters. The committee, which hopes to begin public hearings in May, is trying to wrap up dozens of witness interviews in the coming weeks. Multiple senior Trump administration officials, including senior adviser Jared Kushner and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, are expected to appear virtually before the committee this week. Another senior aide to Vice President Mike Pence, Chris Hodgson, was spotted at the panel's offices for an in-person deposition Wednesday. ""We're going to do everything we can to get everyone's cooperation that we can,"" Raskin said. That ticking clock is having an effect on how far investigators are willing to go to secure the testimony of witnesses and obtain documents. Given the committee's hearing schedule and self-imposed deadline to issue a final report in the fall, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that discussions with Vice President Pence and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani will result in interviews with congressional investigators. The panel is also grappling with the fallout from reports that investigators have obtained text messages from conservative activist Ginni Thomas -- the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas -- pressing then-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to attempt to overturn the election results. Committee members have discussed whether to invite her to testify publicly, but have not publicly shared how they want to proceed. They are also working to fill ""quite a few gaps"" in White House telephone logs obtained by the committee and first reported by The Washington Post and CBS News, Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said Tuesday. Official records of Trump's switchboard phone calls include a nearly 8-hour gap in activity during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, during which time multiple phone conversations Trump is reported to have had with GOP lawmakers may have been made using the cellphones of key aides. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Wednesday that the panel is considering issuing a subpoena for Trump's personal phone records as they work to fill in the gap in the official call logs. ""All of that is up for discussion,"" Thompson said. ""There are some other people in the room who heard conversations during that day. Some people have already said on record they are aware of conversations. So we're trying to fill in the gaps."" Thompson said the gap in the call log ""continues to create a problem"" for the committee, and now ""means we have some additional work to do."" Schiff said the committee is continuing to work to determine what Trump was doing during that time. While Schiff declined to get into specifics, the committee has repeatedly subpoenaed the cellphone records of Trump aides and allies, and has issued blanket preservation requests to telecommunications, social media and email companies and platforms. ""We have multiple sources of information, both in terms of gathering records, as well as witnesses who have come to appear before the committee who have described the president's actions that day,"" Schiff said. ""We are putting together as complete a picture as we can, and not relying on any one source of information."" While some committee members and staffers believe the panel should be taking more aggressive steps in trying to enforce subpoenas, any potential legal disputes might not be resolved before the end of the year, when Republicans may take control of the chamber. On Monday, the panel recommended the full House hold two Trump White House officials, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, in contempt of Congress for ignoring subpoenas for records and testimony. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Wednesday that the House is planning to vote on the matter next week. Trump ally Steve Bannon was indicted for defying the committee's subpoena last November after the full House voted to hold him in contempt. He has pleaded not guilty, and his trial isn't set to begin until May at the earliest. Meadows was also held in contempt by the House in December, but the former chief of staff has yet to face charges from the Justice Department -- leading some lawmakers to criticize the DOJ for its failure to take action. The committee has made clear in court filings that it believes Trump broke the law in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. And while a federal judge wrote this week that it was ""more likely than not"" that Trump committed felonies in the course of his actions, the Justice Department appears to be no closer to charging -- or even considering charging -- the former president with a crime. ""Attorney General Garland: Do your job, so we can do ours,"" Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., said in a committee meeting Monday. ""We would, as a committee, like every entity around with some authority to move,"" Thompson told reporters Tuesday. ""But obviously that's out of our bailiwick.""

"Sources say prosecutors have not yet decided if charges are warranted. Hunter Biden on Ukraine dealings: ‘Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe.’ The federal investigation into President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, over his tax affairs has intensified in recent weeks, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. An increasing number of witnesses have appeared before a grand jury impaneled in Wilmington, Delaware, in recent months, the sources said, and have been asked about payments Hunter Biden received while serving on the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, in addition to other questions about how Biden paid off tax obligations in recent years. The U.S. Attorney's Office for Delaware, which has been leading the investigation, is expected to hear from more witnesses in the coming weeks, sources told ABC News. Sources say that prosecutors have not made a decision yet on whether criminal charges against Biden are warranted, and that there is debate about whether Biden's admitted past drug abuse could serve to undermine a criminal case over his financial decision-making. A spokesperson for the DA's office declined to comment to ABC News, as did a spokesperson for the Justice Department. Chris Clark, an attorney for Hunter Biden, did not respond to a request for comment. The developments in the probe were first reported by The New York Times. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation in December 2020, shortly after his father won the presidency. Since taking office, President Biden has repeatedly pledged to uphold the independence of the Justice Department and not interfere in its work. The tax probe is being led by U.S. Attorney Dan Weiss, a Trump appointee who remained on the job after Biden was sworn in. In a statement released through the Biden-Harris transition team in December 2020, Hunter Biden said that he and his attorney had learned of the investigation just days earlier, and that he was confident that he had handled his tax affairs ""legally and appropriately."" ABC News has previously reported that the investigation began in 2018 -- more than a year before Biden announced his presidential run. Investigators paused their work ahead of the election and waited until after votes were cast to notify Hunter Biden's legal team of the probe, a source told ABC News at the time. Ahead of the 2020 election, political foes of then-candidate Joe Biden -- including then-President Donald Trump -- focused on Hunter Biden's work as a board member for Burisma as well as a series of ill-fated investment endeavors in China. Trump and his allies sought unsuccessfully to characterize Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings over the past decade as evidence of Biden family corruption. ""In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,"" Hunter Biden told ABC News Anchor Amy Robach in October 2019, regarding the impact of his business dealings on his father's political career. ""Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is ... a swamp in -- in -- in many ways? Yeah."" While government watchdogs have broadly taken issue with the ethical implications of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, the federal probe marks the first possible legal threat tied to his overseas work. Sources told ABC News that prosecutors in Delaware are investigating the tax implications of Hunter Biden's work in both China and Ukraine, among other business endeavors.

"""Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated."" Academy considers disciplinary actions for Will Smith Will Smith refused to leave the 94th Academy Awards on Sunday after slapping comedian Chris Rock, according to the Academy. ""Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated,"" the Academy said in a statement on Wednesday. ""While we would like to clarify that Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently."" The Academy also announced that its Board of Governors initiated disciplinary proceedings against Smith ""for violations of the Academy's Standards of Conduct, including inappropriate physical contact, abusive or threatening behavior, and compromising the integrity of the Academy."" Smith went onto the stage at the Oscars Sunday night and slapped Rock after the comedian made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's hair. Back in his seat, Smith then shouted, ""Keep my wife's name out of your f------ mouth,"" twice. Rock would go on to present for best documentary and later in the evening Will Smith won best actor for his role in ""King Richard."" Smith seemingly referenced his confrontation with Rock and apologized to the Academy during his acceptance speech. ""I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern. I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees,"" he said. ""Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things."" Smith formally apologized to the Academy on his Instagram saying, ""I deeply regret that my behavior has stained what has been an otherwise gorgeous journey for all of us."" ""Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally,"" Will Smith added. In response to Sunday night's incident, some celebrities who attended the Oscars are coming forward about how they are still shaken by what happened. Comedian Wanda Sykes, who co-hosted the Academy Awards, said in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres that she is ""sickened""  by what went down on stage. ""I just felt so awful for my friend Chris,"" Sykes said. ""It was sickening. I physically felt ill and I'm still a little traumatized by it."" ""For them to let him stay in that room and enjoy the rest of the show, and accept his award, I was like, 'How gross is this?' This is just the wrong message,"" she added. ""You assault somebody, you get escorted out the building, and that's it."" Now, the Academy said it is giving Smith ""at least 15 days' notice of a vote regarding his violations and sanctions, and the opportunity to be heard beforehand by means of a written response."" At their next board meeting on April 18, the Academy said it may take disciplinary action, which may include suspension, expulsion or other sanctions. ""Mr. Rock, we apologize to you for what you experienced on our stage and thank you for your resilience in that moment,"" the Academy wrote in its statement. ""We also apologize to our nominees, guests and viewers for what transpired during what should have been a celebratory event.""",4
"The decision comes amid concerns that border crossing attempts could spike.  Biden administration to end border restrictions The Department of Homeland Security is expected to move forward this week with lifting Title 42 restrictions -- the Trump-era order giving the government authority to expel migrants at the southern border under a public health emergency -- two government officials told ABC News Wednesday. Democrats and immigrant advocates have strongly opposed the policy, citing concerns over the limits it places on migrants seeking asylum and other forms of humanitarian relief. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he has been ""deeply disappointed"" in the Biden administration for not ending the Title 42 rapid expulsion protocols and he specifically referenced the risks posed to Ukrainian families. ""This is not who we are as a country,"" Schumer said earlier this month. ""Continuing this Trump-era policy defies common sense and common decency. Now's the time to stop the madness. President Biden must fulfill his promise to fully restore our refugee laws, bring order to the border and stop the use of Title 42 to justify these deportations."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is responsible for issuing the order, which was made in the name of public health under the Trump administration at the beginning of the global coronavirus pandemic. The agency is continuing its review and has yet to issue a formal decision, the CDC told ABC News in a statement. ""We are finalizing our current assessment and will release more information later this week,"" the CDC said in a statement. The Associated Press was first to report Title 42 would soon be rescinded. A court battle in which the administration faced a deadline to reimpose categorical expulsions of unaccompanied migrant minors or to ask an appellate court to intervene resulted in the administration rescinding the Title 42 policy for unaccompanied children once again earlier this month. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC News the administration is at fault for not more expansively implementing the Migrant Protection Protocols, a tool first used by President Donald Trump to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their claims to process in the U.S. ""Reports the president will rescind Title 42 after refusing to properly implement MPP is setting the stage for hundreds of thousands more illegal encounters and the continued flow of deadly drugs that will poison our communities, as well as opening the door to further human trafficking and misery,"" McCaul said. While the Biden administration has announced billions in funding for more than two dozen projects to expand and modernize U.S. border crossings, it's not clear those funds will be enough to sufficiently expand the processing capacity of Customs and Border Protection facilities. The primary goal is to improve commerce and trade with new security and sustainability features so federal facilities catch up to the expansion of trade in recent years, administration officials said in announcing the funding plan last month. The $3.4 billion investment comes from the bipartisan infrastructure law. Delays and long lines at land ports of entry are common, especially at the nation's highest trafficked regions, like San Diego. On the southern border alone, delays have cost 88,000 jobs and roughly $3 billion in economic output, according to a 2016 study of cross-border trade. ""Those inefficiencies translate into a weaker economy, fewer jobs and we can do better,"" U.S. General Services Administrator Robin Carnahan told reporters at an event announcing the border funding. ""A lot of these land ports are beyond their useful life and their capacity in many ways and these upgrades that we're talking about today are long overdue."" The AP reported the repeal date for Title 42 is slated for May 23. That timeline would put immense pressure on the U.S. Border Patrol to enact a plan that will allow for the safe processing of migrant taken into custody. ""If in fact they do get rid of it on May 23 they're barely giving us a month and a half to get prepared,"" Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, told ABC News Wednesday. ""There's just no way to get an operation of that magnitude in place in that short of a period of time without there being complete chaos. It's impossible.""

"The Pentagon says its concerned about Putin being misinformed by advisers. Russia shells areas in Ukraine where it vowed to scale back Over the last 24 hours, the Pentagon has seen ""less than 20%"" of the Russian troops that had been around Kyiv moving northward as they ""reposition"" into Belarus so they can be re-equipped for possible action in eastern Ukraine, the Pentagon's top spokesman said Wednesday. Also, The White House said Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his top advisers about military developments in Russia, a development that the Pentagon labeled as ""disconcerting."" ""We have seen over the last 24 hours the repositioning of a small percentage of the troops and the battalion tactical groups that Russia had arrayed against Kyiv,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Wednesday. ""Probably in the neighborhood of 20% of what they had, they are beginning to reposition some of those troops."" Specifically, Kirby said the Russian troops near the Hostomel airport north of the city have been seen moving north towards Belarus. The airport had been the scene of heavy fighting from the opening hours of Russia's invasion. Separately, a senior U.S. defense official said some Russian troops had also been seen moving out of the Chernobyl nuclear facility. However, it remained unclear if they would all be leaving. Some of those troops are being moved into Belarus, said Kirby, who added that none of the units have been seen returning to their home bases. ""If the Russians are serious about de-escalating, because that's their claim here, then they should send them home, but they're not doing that, at least not yet,"" Kirby said. ""That's not what we're seeing."" Kirby said he was intentionally using the term reposition instead of a withdrawal to describe the movement of Russian forces ""because the way it's being spun by the Ministry of Defense is that they're that they're pulling back and they're trying to de-escalate and depressurize the situation and we just don't believe we haven't seen any evidence of that."" Instead, Kirby said the U.S. assesses that the Russians are ""going to refit these troops, resupply them, and then probably employ them elsewhere in Ukraine."" A senior U.S. defense official said U.S. intelligence believes that Russia may intend to shift some of these troops towards the fight in the Donbas region, which would be in line with public statements from Russian officials that they want to make that region a priority of their operations. Even as some of the Russian troops around Kyiv move away, Kirby and the rest have established defensive positions. Kirby noted that Russian forces continue to launch missiles and artillery at the city and surrounding suburbs. Kirby said that without getting into intelligence, the Pentagon concurred with comments in news reports attributed to a U.S. official that Putin is not being fully advised of Russia's performance on the battlefield in Ukraine. ""We would concur with the conclusion that Mr. Putin has not been fully informed by his Ministry of Defense at every turn over the last month,"" Kirby said Wednesday. Kirby described that assessment as ""disconcerting"" and ""an issue of concern."" ""The fact that he may not have all the context, that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that's a little discomforting, to be honest with you,"" Kirby said. ""If he's not fully informed of how poorly he's doing, then how are his negotiators going to come up with an agreement that is enduring? Certainly one that respects Ukrainian sovereignty,"" he added. ""The other thing is you don't know how a leader like that is going to react to getting bad news,"" Kirby said. '",3
"The German government’s panel of independent economic advisers has slashed its 2022 growth forecast for Europe’s biggest economy in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and concern over energy supplies and prices On Location: March 30, 2022 BERLIN -- The German government's panel of independent economic advisers on Wednesday slashed its 2022 growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and concern over energy supplies and prices. The group forecast that Germany's gross domestic product will expand by only 1.8% this year, compared with the 4.6% it predicted in November. It said the economy won't return to its pre-pandemic level until the third quarter. Last year, the country's GDP grew by 2.9%; in the final quarter of 2021, it shrank by 0.3% compared with the previous three-month period. “The high dependence on Russian energy supplies entails a considerable risk of lower economic output and even a recession with significantly higher inflation rates,” the panel said. The economists said in a statement that “Germany should immediately do everything possible to take precautions against a suspension of Russian energy supplies and quickly end its dependence on Russian energy sources.” They added that “in the long term, the goal must be to ensure higher energy security, for example by expanding renewable energies and diversifying energy imports.” Those steps reflect the German government's policy. Shortly before the economists released their forecast, Germany triggered an early warning level for natural gas supplies amid concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless it is paid in rubles. The panel of advisers forecast growth of 3.6% in 2023. In a separate report Wednesday, the Federal Statistical Office estimated that Germany’s year-on-year inflation rate leapt from 5.1% in February to 7.3% in March. It pointed to the effect of the war on gas and oil prices, as well as bottlenecks caused by delivery chain interruptions due to the pandemic. ——— An earlier version of this story was corrected to show that Germany's 2021 GDP was revised to 2.9% from 2.8%; and GDP shrank in the fourth quarter by 0.3%, not 0.7%.",6
"Britain says it's withdrawing its judges from Hong Kong’s top court because keeping them there would legitimize oppression in the former British colony On Location: March 30, 2022 LONDON -- Britain said Wednesday that it is withdrawing its judges from Hong Kong’s top court because keeping them there would legitimize oppression in the former British colony. British judges have sat on the court since Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. The British government's move underscores the Asian financial hub’s growing isolation as the ruling Chinese Communist Party works to assert its control and silence independent voices. While the U.K. had judges serving on the Court of Final Appeal as part of efforts to safeguard the rule of law in the city, the British government said it was “no longer tenable"" because of increasingly oppressive laws enacted by China. The two senior British judges on the court submitted their resignations with immediate effect Wednesday. “The courts in Hong Kong continue to be internationally respected for their commitment to the rule of law,” U.K. Supreme Court President Robert Reed said after his resignation from the Hong Kong court. “Nevertheless, I have concluded, in agreement with the government, that the judges of the Supreme Court cannot continue to sit in Hong Kong without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression.” Fourteen non-permanent judges remain at the Hong Kong court, including 10 from other common law jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada. China has intensified its crackdown on Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous political and legal institutions in recent years. Those efforts include passage of a sweeping national security law in 2020 and changes to the electoral system that have effectively ended political opposition in the territory. The security law, which outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign collusion, has been used to arrest more than 100 pro-democracy figures, and many others have fled abroad. Since the law's introduction, Hong Kong police have raided the offices of pro-democracy media, shutting them down and arresting journalists. Lawmakers, students and the organizers of candlelit memorials marking Communist Party's deadly 1989 crackdown on a pro-democracy movement have also been targeted. Some Western governments and the United Nations say the security law is eroding the autonomy promised when the city was transferred back to China under the “one country, two systems” principle. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the two U.K. judges had “concluded that the constraints of the national security law make it impossible for them to continue to serve in the way that they would want.” “I appreciate and I understand their decision,” he said. In announcing the move, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there had been “a systematic erosion of liberty and democracy in Hong Kong.” “The situation has reached a tipping point where it is no longer tenable for British judges to sit on Hong Kong’s leading court, and would risk legitimizing oppression,” she said. The decision to pull British judges out after many years in Hong Kong was welcomed by British lawmakers. A senior Conservative Party member of Parliament, Tom Tugendhat, said British judges should not help empower “a legal system that is now being used to lock up Hongkongers without due process.” Conservative lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith, a longtime critic of the government in Beijing, said “the government has done the right thing here, and not a minute too soon.” “What Ukraine teaches us is that you simply cannot appease totalitarian states or make excuses for their behavior, which is exactly what the presence of our judges (was) doing in Hong Kong,'' Duncan Smith said. “They were lending legitimacy to a regime hell-bent on undermining our way of life.” The Hong Kong Bar Association called the decision “a matter of deep regret.” It appealed to the Court of Final Appeal's remaining overseas judges to stay and serve the city, and help uphold its judicial independence. ——— Elaine Kurtenbach contributed reporting from Bangkok.",3
"Germany and Austria have activated early warning plans amid concerns that Moscow could cut natural gas deliveries On Location: April 1, 2022 BERLIN -- Germany and Austria activated early warning plans Wednesday amid concerns that Moscow could cut natural gas deliveries, while Poland announced steps to end all Russian oil imports by year’s end, in fresh signs of how Russia's war in Ukraine is affecting Europe's energy security. The German government said it was establishing a crisis team to step up monitoring of the gas supply, and called on companies and households to conserve energy following demands by Russia that deliveries should be paid in rubles. Western nations have rejected that demand, arguing it would undermine sanctions imposed because of the war. “There have been several comments from the Russian side that if this (payments in rubles) doesn’t happen, then the supplies will be stopped,” Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters in Berlin. Hours later, German officials said Chancellor Olaf Scholz had received assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin that European companies won’t have to pay for Russian gas supplies in rubles but could continue to pay in euros as stipulated by existing contracts. Scholz had asked for further details of the process, which involves payments to a Russian bank not subjected to sanctions, his office said. Habeck had earlier said that the level one warning triggered — a step also taken Wednesday by Austria — was a precautionary measure and Germany was prepared for a sudden stop in Russian gas supplies. Still, he warned of “considerable impacts” if that were to happen and urged consumers to help prevent a shortage by conserving energy. “We are in a situation where, I have to say this clearly, every kilowatt hour of energy saved helps,” Habeck said. He added that Germany’s gas storages are currently filled to about 25% capacity. A second warning level would require companies in the gas industry to take necessary measures to regulate supply. The third and highest level entails full state intervention to ensure those who most need gas — such as hospitals and private households — receive it, Habeck said. “We’re not there and we don’t want to go there,” he added. France also called Wednesday for “those who can” to conserve energy, including electricity and gas, focusing especially on businesses and public facilities. The country's gas storage facilities are “well filled,” according to the head of its Regulatory Energy Commission, but still asked for some efforts to save energy. “If we don’t do that, there is a risk next winter for consumption demand to be superior to our ability to meet that demand,” Jean-Francois Carenco told the BFM news broadcaster. France gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear plants but uses natural gas during peak demand at winter time and for home heating. Italy issued a pre-alert of the risks to its natural gas supply days after the war broke out, given its heavy reliance on Russia. Energy transition minister Roberto Cingolani said at the time that the warning aimed to inform users of the “uncertainties linked to the conflict,” while confirming supplies remained adequate to cover demand. It has not asked people to conserve. Meanwhile Poland, which has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees, has taken the lead in the European Union on swiftly cutting off Russian fossil fuels. The 27-nation bloc has declined to sanction energy because it depends on Moscow for the fuel needed for cars, electricity, heating and industry, but it has announced proposals to wean itself off those supplies. “We are presenting the most radical plan in Europe for departing from Russian oil by the end of this year,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at a news conference. On Tuesday Poland said it was banning Russian coal imports, expected by May. Morawiecki said Poland will take steps to become “independent” of Russian supplies and called on other European Union countries to “walk away” as well. He argued that money paid for Russia’s oil and gas is fueling its war machine. While some in Europe are calling for an immediate boycott of all Russian oil and natural gas, the EU plans to reduce Russian gas imports by two-thirds by the end of the year and eliminate them before 2030. In the meantime, rattled energy markets have pushed up already high oil and natural gas prices for Europeans and others worldwide. The EU is turning to investments in renewable energy as a long-term fix but also is scrambling to shore up alternative sources of fossil fuels, including a new agreement with the U.S. to receive more liquefied natural gas, or LNG, that arrives by ship. Poland is expanding an LNG terminal to receive deliveries from Qatar, the U.S., Norway and other exporters. A new Baltic pipeline bringing gas from Norway is expected to open by the end of the year. It also has been reducing dependence on Russian oil through contracts with Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and Norway and is considering imports from Kazakhstan. Germany, the EU's biggest economy and until recently reliant on Russia's natural gas for 55% of its needs, has signed deals with several suppliers of LNG, which is shipped to neighboring European countries and then pumped in. German officials say they aim to end the use of Russian oil and coal this year and natural gas by mid-2024. ——— Scislowska reported from Warsaw.

"Several Republicans see this as a moment for a new take on foreign policy. Is Putin's invasion of Ukraine backfiring? The TAKE with Rick Klein It's an awful war with an American ally asking for more than an increasingly unpopular Democratic president is willing to give -- and gas prices are showing voters the costs along the way. A range of ambitious Republicans see this as a moment for a new take on foreign policy that gets the party back to its traditional roots. But there's a contrarian voice that happens to be a loud one, and it isn't going away. Former President Donald Trump's latest call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to release what he knows about Hunter Biden -- ""I think he should release it,"" Trump said in an interview this week, referring to information on financial relationships involving Biden's son -- is particularly ill-timed for the GOP. It comes at a time where Putin is isolated and erratic and while the federal investigation centering on the president's son is intensifying, without any help from Putin. Trump's influence on the party on the Putin question is evident in comments such as those from Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., who earlier this month called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""thug."" The House vote two weeks ago to strip Russia and Belarus of normal trade status was unanimous except for eight Republicans. Some of their names -- Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert -- are familiar figures in the MAGA orbit. From the White House perspective, the latest comments from Trump are an opportunity to turn questions about the president's son into answers. ""What kind of American, let alone an ex-president, thinks that this is the right time to enter into a scheme with Vladimir Putin and brag about his connections to Vladimir Putin?"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield asked Tuesday. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, has signed legislation that will prohibit transgender students from participating in girls and women's sports. Stitt signed the bill, called the ""Save Women's Sports Act,"" into law Wednesday -- the eve of Transgender Day of Visibility. ""When it comes to sports and athletics, girls should compete against girls. Boys should compete against boys,"" Stitt, who is running for re-election, said. Oklahoma's controversial legislation is a part of a wave of similar legislation targeting transgender athletes pushed by GOP lawmakers in states across the country. Advocates widely consider this sort of legislation harmful to transgender youth. ""These bills are wrong,"" President Joe Biden said in a proclamation marking Transgender Day of Visibility 2022. ""Efforts to criminalize supportive medical care for transgender kids, to ban transgender children from playing sports and to outlaw discussing LGBTQI+ people in schools undermine their humanity and corrode our Nation's values."" Stitt's signage also came on the same day that a group of 21 House Republicans introduced a resolution that not only misgenders Lia Thomas, an NCAA swimming champion and transgender student athlete at the University of Pennsylvania, but also uses her birth name to claim that Thomas ""stole"" the championship trophy and declares another female swimmer the ""rightful winner."" The push led by Rep. Lauren Boebert is unlikely to gain traction, but it is noteworthy given that it has cosponsors who represent 15 states across the country. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema  The political implications of ending Title 42 are once again highlighting divisions over the nation's immigration policies both across the aisle and within parties. The Trump-era emergency order remains part of the U.S. public health code and allows for the expulsion of migrants without giving them a chance to apply for asylum within the United States. ""Title 42 is a public health directive. It is not an immigration or migration enforcement measure. So the decision on when to lift Title 42 we defer to the CDC,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told reporters Wednesday. ""We are planning for multiple contingencies, and we have every expectation that when the CDC ultimately decides it's appropriate to lift Title 42, there will be an influx of people to the border, and so we are doing a lot of work to plan for that contingency,"" she added. Those comments come on the heels of the Department of Homeland Security saying the agency is ??bracing for as many as 18,000 migrants per day at the southern border and also after the Biden administration announced it would welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, all while signaling a push for Americans to bounce back from pandemic times. The overlapping priorities present a complicated scenario for the administration to navigate, especially as several members of the president's own party -- some of whom are tied up in pivotal midterm races -- say they disagree with ending the policy at this time. Democrats representing border areas, including Arizona Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly as well as Texas Reps. Vicente Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar, have called on the White House to leave Title 42 in place. Sen. Joe Manchin was also among those asking for an extension of the policy. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight  220-223.  That's the number of red-leaning seats that will likely show up on the 2022 congressional map. While congressional redistricting is not quite finished, it's getting darn close. It looks like Republicans' historical advantage in the House will be smaller than it has been in decades -- mostly because Democrats have gained seats through gerrymandering. Based on the new House maps that have already passed and the range of possible outcomes in the remaining states, FiveThirtyEight estimates that the 2022 congressional map will end up with 220-223 districts with Republican-leaning partisan leans and 212-215 districts with Democratic-leaning partisan leans, making it a pretty even split.

"A Kremlin decree published by state media says “unfriendly countries” can continue to pay for natural gas in foreign currency through a Russian bank that will convert the money into rubles ROME -- “Unfriendly countries"" can continue to pay for natural gas in foreign currency through a Russian bank that will convert the money into rubles, according to a Kremlin decree published by state media Thursday, a day after the leaders of Italy and Germany said they received assurances from President Vladimir Putin. Putin talked tougher, saying Russia will start accepting ruble payments starting Friday for Western countries that imposed sanctions over its conflict with Ukraine. He said contracts will be stopped if buyers don’t sign up to the new conditions, including opening ruble accounts in Russian banks. “If these payments are not made, we will consider it a failure of the buyer to fulfil its obligations, with all the ensuing consequences,"" Putin said. The decree Putin signed and published by state news agency RIA Novosti says a designated bank will open two accounts for each buyer, one in foreign currency and one in rubles. The buyers will pay in foreign currency and authorize the bank to sell that currency for rubles, which are placed in the second account, where the gas is formally purchased. Speaking shortly after Putin’s announcement, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave a noncommittal initial response to Russia’s new conditions. He said the gas contracts stipulate payment mostly in euros and sometimes in dollars. He said he made clear to Putin in a phone call Wednesday “that it will stay that way.” “What his ideas are for how this can happen is what we will now look at closely,” Scholz told a reporters in Berlin. “But in any case, what goes for companies is that they want to and will be able to pay in euros.” Italian Premier Mario Draghi said earlier Thursday that he had also received assurances from Putin that Europe would not have to pay in rubles and diffused fears that Moscow would cut off supplies of gas used for heating and electricity. Draghi said Putin assured him during a 40-minute phone call Wednesday evening that “existing contracts remain in force. ... European companies will continue to pay in dollars and euros.” Putin announced last week that Russia will demand “unfriendly” countries pay for natural gas only in Russian currency, instructing the central bank to work out a procedure for buyers to acquire rubles in Russia. That sent already high gas prices even higher amid fears it could be a prelude to a natural gas shutoff, which could disrupt Europe’s economy and hurt Russia’s finances. The Group of Seven major economies, including Italy and Germany, agreed to reject the demand. Draghi said Putin gave a lengthy explanation of how to both maintain the payments in euros and dollars while satisfying Russia’s “indication of payments in rubles.’’ Draghi said he referred the discussion to experts and that analysis was underway “to understand what it means,” including whether “European companies can continue to pay as foreseen, if this means something for the ongoing sanctions.” “The feeling is one I have had since the beginning, that it is absolutely not simple to change the currency of payments without violating the contracts,'' Draghi said. Draghi also told the foreign press corps that Europe is pushing for a cap on gas prices with Russia, saying its payments are funding the war in Ukraine and the prices being paid by Europe are out of line with the global market. “We — Germany and Italy, along with other countries that are importers of gas, coal, grains, corn — are financing the war. There is no doubt,’’ Draghi said. “For this reason, Italy along with other countries, are pushing for a cap on the price of gas. There is no substantial reason that the price of gas is so high for Europeans.” Draghi noted that Russia has no other market for its gas, giving Europe room to maneuver. Asked about the risk that Russia would respond by turning off the taps, Draghi said, “no there is no danger.” The prospect of continued gas deliveries in exchange for euros drew a cautious welcome from German industry. “It’s good news at least in the short term, because Russian gas deliveries can’t be replaced in the short term,” Achim Dercks, the deputy managing director of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told RBB24 Inforadio on Thursday. He noted that companies are concerned that any cutoff would affect industry in particular, “but ultimately that would have severe economic effects for us all.” ——— AP reporter Colleen Barry in Milan contributed.",6
"The foreign ministers of Britain and Russia are visiting India as its government seeks to maintain ties with both Moscow and Western nations despite the worsening Ukraine war NEW DELHI -- The foreign ministers of Britain and Russia are visiting India as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to maintain ties with both Moscow and Western nations despite the worsening Ukraine war and humanitarian crisis. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met with her Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on Thursday and discussed ways to strengthen defense ties, apparently to reduce India's strategic dependence on Russia, officials said. Western countries are disappointed at India’s reluctance to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. India, which is locked in a two-year border standoff with China, is largely dependent on Russia for military supplies. Truss said it was vitally important for freedom and democracy in Europe to challenge Putin's invasion and ensure that he loses in Ukraine. ""If he was able to have success in invading a sovereign nation, what message will that send to other aggressors?"" she said at a separate meeting of the India-U.K. Strategic Futures Forum. ""The implication of this crisis is far-reaching. We are seeing global food shortages, energy shortages and security threatened. This to me highlights the need for like-minded nations to work together and for us to work more closely with India to strengthen our economic ties, security ties and defense ties,"" she said. She also called for tighter sanctions to check Russia's ability to use gold reserves and oil and gas revenues, and said that next week's meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations will discuss a timeline for reducing energy dependence on Moscow. After the meeting, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters in Washington the U.S. is seeking international unity ""speaking loudly against this unjustified, unprovoked, premeditated aggression.” “Different countries are going to have their own relationship with the Russian Federation,"" Price said. “We understand that. What we are asking for, what we’re calling for, is that all countries use the leverage that they have to make sure that that message is coming across.” On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Jaishankar by telephone and discussed the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine. They also discussed the two nations’ efforts to promote a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific, Price said. Before leaving for New Delhi, Truss in a statement underlined the need “for free democracies to work closer together in areas like defense, trade and cybersecurity in the context of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.” In January, India and Britain launched talks on a free trade deal that is expected to double their current $50 billion bilateral trade by 2030. ""Working together to realize Roadmap 2030,"" Jaishankar tweeted after receiving Truss. Truss and Jaishankar met hours before the arrival in New Delhi of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who is to hold talks with Jaishankar on Friday in an attempt to prevent India's military and trade ties with Russia from becoming a victim of the Ukraine crisis. Earlier this month, India hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh visited New Delhi this week to discuss deeper cooperation to promote economic growth and a free and open Indo-Pacific, the U.S. Embassy said.",6
"Biden pledged to end the war, which has now entered its eighth year. On Location: March 31, 2022 ALGIERS, Algeria -- One of President Joe Biden's first foreign policy moves was a pledge to help end one of the world's worst humanitarian crises – the war in Yemen – by ""stepping up our diplomacy"" and ""ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales."" More than a year later, the war has escalated – with a sharp increase in civilian casualties, a growing number of Yemenis facing hunger, with less humanitarian funding, less international oversight of airstrikes and more complex attacks against Yemen's neighbors fighting in the conflict. A possible new cease-fire for Islam's holy month of Ramadan could be within reach, the United Nations special envoy for Yemen indicated Wednesday, as he promotes a new peace plan. The Saudi-led coalition announced a unilateral cease-fire starting Wednesday, days after the Houthi rebels announced their own on cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. ""I don't want to overstate it because we've been here before, but there's a chance that we actually have a path forward with the new special envoy laying out what is a credible plan,"" a senior State Department official told ABC News. Temporary cease-fires and new peace plans have come and gone for seven years now, with the Yemeni people left to suffer the consequences. Nearly 400,000 people are believed to have been killed by fighting, disease and starvation, according to a U.N. report. Over 20 million – two-thirds of the population – are now reliant on humanitarian aid, including two million children facing acute malnutrition. ""The world cannot forget about Yemen,"" said Tamuna Sabadze, the country director for the International Rescue Committee, an aid group on the ground in Yemen – a country the size of California and long the Arab world's poorest. ""The suffering has continued for too long. Those with influence over the warring parties must work to deliver a diplomatic resolution to this crisis."" The Houthis, a northern rebel group increasingly backed by Iran, swept to power in 2014 when they seized the capital, Sanaa, amid Arab Spring strife. In response, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and an Arab coalition launched a military intervention – seven years ago this past Saturday – to prop up the Yemeni government and keep from power what they saw as an Iranian proxy. Biden brought new attention to the war early in his term, including by naming career diplomat Tim Lenderking as special envoy for Yemen. On one side, critics, including Republicans and Saudi and Emirati officials, blame increased fighting on his decision to remove the Houthis from the foreign terrorist organization list. On the other, especially among members of Biden's own party, there have been accusations that the administration is not doing enough to pressure the Saudi-led coalition to end the war. It's unclear if measures prescribed by critics on either side would do just that. The last year of diplomatic efforts hasn't. But amid rockier ties with those Gulf Arab partners, the Biden administration is shifting toward them – redoubling support for their defense and increasing pressure on the Houthis. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met the UAE's de facto ruler, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayan, on Tuesday during a tour of the region. They spent two hours together at a private residence of MBZ, as the powerful prince is known, in Morocco – including a 30-minute one-on-one stroll around the compound. A senior State Department official said Wednesday the two discussed ""different mechanisms"" to elevate U.S. support for the UAE's security, although not an official treaty or security guarantee. But after an increasing number of deadly Houthi attacks on Saudi and Emirati civilian infrastructure, the U.S. is now considering ""everything from sanctions to interdictions to other means of preventing [the Houthis] from being able to wage attacks against not just the Emiratis, but the Saudis, as well as within Yemen,"" they added. Houthi attacks have gotten increasingly sophisticated and deadly – killing civilians, striking airports and oil facilities, and using ballistic missiles and drones that are supplied by Iran. Many have come to view the militant group as a proxy force for Iran, which has taken advantage of the war to destabilize its chief rivals in the region, the Saudis and Emiratis. One form of pressure the Emiratis and Saudis are unlikely to get, however, is re-adding the Houthis to the State Department's foreign terrorist organization list, a designation that carries similar sanctions to those the Houthis are already under, but adds potential criminal prosecutions for anyone supporting them. Emirati officials in particular have been lobbying for a reversal, with Biden announcing in January that one is under consideration and the State Department consistently calling Houthi attacks ""terrorism."" But even as they review re-designating the Houthis, the senior State Department official said, the administration's argument for the last year against the designation remains – that it would restrict aid flowing into Yemen because of that threat of prosecutions. ""It's fair to say that they [the Emiratis] and others in the region see the FTO designation in one way, whereas we see it primarily through the impact on our ability to deliver and support humanitarian assistance,"" the senior State Department official told ABC News. Still, the talk of strong support for UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others is a far cry from where some members of Biden's own party are. ""Saudi Arabia's airstrikes and air-and-sea blockade have cost hundreds of thousands of lives and threatened millions more with famine, triggering the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. On this grim anniversary – spanning seven years and three presidential administrations – we are calling for an immediate end to American involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's brutal military campaign,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders and three progressive House members – Pramila Jayapal, Peter DeFazio, and Ro Khanna – adding they will use a War Powers resolution to force his hand. The U.S. military's involvement in the conflict has been limited since November 2018 when, under similar bipartisan pressure, the Trump administration halted midair refueling for Saudi-led coalition aircraft. That air force has been accused by the U.N. of potential war crimes – indiscriminate bombardments and targeting civilian infrastructure. The Houthis have also been accused of potential war crimes, including indiscriminate attacks and land mines, according to the same U.N. panel. Increasingly, they've also conducted complex, coordinated attacks on Saudi Arabia and UAE – including one last Friday that set two Saudi Aramco facilities ablaze and sent black smoke billowing into the air. While there were no casualties, Saudi officials said it would affect oil production amid the global energy crunch. Fighting in recent months has been worse than in years – with more January the deadliest month since 2018 – just three months after the UN Human Rights Council voted to disband that U.N. panel investigating war crimes. While the majority of civilians have been killed by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, the senior State Department official said the coalition ""has been saying they're prepared to engage"" in negotiations towards a cease-fire and ultimately a political resolution. The coalition on Wednesday launched a unilateral cease-fire. The U.N.'s new special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, welcomed it as part of his call for a truce for Ramadan, Islam's holy month which starts this weekend. Grundberg has been conducting extensive consultations with not just the warring countries, but also political parties, civil society activists, and women's rights advocates. The Gulf Cooperation Council, a Riyadh-based bloc of regional countries, is also hosting a peace conference this week of Yemeni parties. The Houthis have rejected both the Saudi cease-fire and the GCC summit, but days earlier announced they would halt to cross-border attacks until Wednesday, refusing to extend it unless the coalition met certain demands. Those demands – ending restrictions on Yemeni ports and closure of Sanaa's airport – were not met, but it's unclear if the Houthis had resumed attacks. Still, Grundberg expressed some hope Wednesday that his team was ""making progress"" on reaching a truce – telling the GCC summit, ""Yemen needs a truce. I am engaging with the parties with a sense of urgency to reach this truce by the beginning of Ramadan."" In the meantime, it's the Yemeni people who suffer – a crisis now exacerbated by Russia's war against Ukraine. Yemen imports approximately one-fifth of its wheat from the two countries, and with energy prices also soaring, the already severely underfunded humanitarian response is left reeling. That's left children like ""Isaac"" with dimmer futures. In addition to widespread malnutrition, approximately 10,000 children have been killed by the war. Some two million children are out of school, with over 25,000 schools damaged or destroyed. Isaac, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, told the aid group Save the Children that his school ""is definitely not safe anymore."" The 14-year old boy was shot by a sniper in the leg. ""I assumed the sniper would spare me when he saw I was only picking up the ball. He doesn't usually shoot at us, he rarely does, but he did this time,"" he said, according to the group.",6
"Biden told Americans there's ""no firm answer"" for when gas prices will go down. Biden announces order to release 180M barrels of oil Attempting to combat what's he's labeled ""Putin's price hike,"" President Joe Biden announced a plan on Thursday to release roughly 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve over the next six months to reduce energy and gas prices. Biden told Americans ""there is no firm answer"" as to when gas prices will go down, but predicted they will go down ""fairly significantly."" ""Today I want to talk about one aspect of Putin's war that affects and has real effects on the American people: Putin's price hike that Americans and our allies are feeling at the pump. I know how much it hurts,"" Biden began. ""As you've heard me say I grew up in a family, like many of you, where the price of gasoline was discussed at the kitchen table. None of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war."" Biden blamed ""two roots"" for the high energy costs: Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the lingering economic effects of COVID-19. ""When COVID struck, demand for oil plummeted, so production slowed down worldwide. Because of the strength and the speed of our recovery, demand for oil shot back up much faster than the supply. That's why the cost of gas began to rise last year. The second root is Vladimir Putin,"" he said. Biden predicted Americans could pay ""anything from 10 cents to 35 cents a gallon"" less at the pump, setting up the national average would fall below $4 a gallon. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for Gas Buddy, pointed ABC News to a tweet in which he raised some skepticism. ""I do believe the national average could eventually fall under $4/gal in the weeks ahead, but I don't necessarily think this SPR release is the event that will be the primary catalyst for it,"" he said in a tweet Thursday. ""If anything it could help get us there quicker, but again, likely at the expense of long term stability."" Biden announced the major step during a scheduled event to discuss actions his administration is taking to rein in soaring energy prices that have spiked even further following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""The action I'm calling for will make a real difference over time, but the truth is, it takes months, not days, for companies to increase production. That's why the next part of my plan is so important,"" he said. ""Today I'm authorizing the release of 1 million barrels per day over the next six months."" He said the release was coordinated with allies and partners around the world. Speaking directly to oil company executives, Biden told them “enough of lavishing excessive profits” and passing on the cost of oil to consumers, adding that they have “everything they need” and “nothing is standing in their way” to boost production. “They don't want to increase supply because Putin's price hike means higher profits,"" Biden said. He went on to propose a ""use it or lose it"" policy, calling on Congress to create legislation to tax companies if they're sitting on idle wells and lands that aren't producing for Americans. ""No company should take advantage of a pandemic or Vladimir Putin at the expense of American families,"" Biden said. ""Production and innovation, that's what they should do."" ""Invest in your customers,"" he added, noting that it's not only ""the patriotic thing"" but ""it's good for your business as well."" Senior administration officials also acknowledged relief at the pump may be delayed. ""We're not focused right now on sort of the immediate short-term price movements,"" an official said on a call with reporters earlier Thursday, adding that the focus is on addressing the gap in supply as Russian oil comes off the market. The first barrels from the announcement are set to come to the market in May for delivery that month. Officials said all the funds from the sale of the oil will go to restocking the reserves. ""We expect that to occur once the oil price has come down, we are no longer in an emergency,"" an official told reporters. About 3 million barrels a day of Russian oil will come off the market in April due to Western sanctions, according to the International Energy Agency, and this plan could help alleviate pain at the pump by helping to replace that loss. This would be the third time Biden has had to tap into the strategic petroleum reserve. In November, he authorized the release of 50 million barrels as gas prices surged ahead of the holidays, and along with 30 other countries, the U.S. released 30 million barrels following the start of the war in Ukraine, though that did little to ease skyrocketing prices. As of Friday, there were more than 568 million barrels of oil in the reserve, according to the Department of Energy. Given the complexity and volatility of the oil market, many geopolitical and economic factors feed into oil prices and there is no guarantee this release will keep prices down for an extended period of time. Overnight, crude oil prices were down roughly 5% in reaction to Biden's expected announcement, which means the price at the gas pump could also dip in the coming days. The current national average for a gallon of gas is $4.23, according to AAA, $1.35 higher than this time last year.",9
"President Joe Biden is commemorating Transgender Day of Visibility by celebrating prominent transgender Americans On Location: March 31, 2022 WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is commemorating Transgender Day of Visibility by celebrating prominent transgender Americans and advocating against what his administration terms “dangerous anti-transgender legislative attacks"" that have passed in statehouses across the country. Biden on Thursday is announcing new measures aimed at making the federal government more inclusive for transgender people, including a new “X” gender marker on U.S. passport applications beginning on April 11 and new Transportation Security Administration scanners that are gender-neutral. The Democratic president's administration is working to expand the availability of the “X” gender marker to airlines and federal travel programs and will make it easier for transgender people to change their gender information in Social Security Administration records. Visitors to the White House will soon also be able to select an “X” gender marker option in the White House Worker and Visitor Entry System, which is used to conduct screening background checks for visitors to the executive mansion. At airports, there will changes to screening scanners as well as the use of an “X” for travelers going through Precheck who do not identify as male or female. TSA officers will receive new instructions on screening intended to make procedures less invasive. The TSA will work with airlines to promote the acceptance of the “X” gender marker. “Transgender Americans continue to face discrimination, harassment, and barriers to opportunity,” Biden wrote in a proclamation marking the day. “In the past year, hundreds of anti-transgender bills in States were proposed across America, most of them targeting transgender kids. The onslaught has continued this year. These bills are wrong."" Biden also planned to release a video message to transgender Americans on Thursday. “Jeopardy!” champion Amy Schneider, the first openly transgender winner on the quiz show, will visit the White House on Thursday to meet with second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Emhoff, along with Admiral Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, will also host a conversation with transgender kids and their parents at the White House. In Florida, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will meet with LGBTQ+ students in the wake of the state's new law that bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through the third grade. Republicans argue that parents should broach these subjects with children. Democrats have said the law demonizes LGBTQ people by excluding them from classroom lessons. “Their conversation will focus on the impacts of Florida’s so-called ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, students’ experiences at school and, in particular, support for LGBTQI+ student mental health and well-being,” the White House said. HHS, the White House said, will also be the first agency to fly a trans pride flag.",1
"President Joe Biden is ordering the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months in a bid to control energy prices US average gas prices come down to $4.24 per gallon WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is ordering the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months, the White House said Thursday, in a bid to control energy prices that have spiked as the U.S. and allies imposed steep sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Biden was to formally announce the release in remarks on his administration’s plans to combat rising gas prices. The White House said Biden would also call on Congress to impose financial penalties on oil and gas companies that lease public lands but aren’t producing. He also intends to invoke the Defense Production Act to encourage the mining of critical minerals for batteries in electric vehicles. The White House characterized the release of the petroleum as a bridge until output increases from domestic producers. Administration officials estimate that average production will grow by 1 million barrels daily this year and an additional 700,000 barrels daily in 2023. The move by Biden shows that oil remains a key vulnerability for the U.S. at home and abroad. Higher prices have hurt Biden’s approval domestically, while also adding billions of oil-export dollars to the Russian war chest as it wages war on Ukraine. The release of reserves in the U.S. would create pressures that could reduce oil prices, though Biden has already twice ordered releases from the strategic reserves without causing a meaningful shift in oil markets. Part of Biden's concern is that high prices have not — so far — coaxed a meaningful jump in oil production. The planned release is a way to increase supplies. The markets reacted quickly with crude oil prices dropping more than 3% on Thursday morning to roughly $104 a barrel. Still, oil is up from roughly $60 a year ago, with supplies failing to keep up with demand as the world economy has begun to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Americans on average use about 21 million barrels of oil daily, with about 40% of the consumption devoted to gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Domestic oil production is equal to more than half of the country's usage, but high prices have not led companies to return to their pre-pandemic levels of output. The U.S. is producing on average 11.7 million barrels daily, down from 13 million barrels in early 2020. Republican lawmakers have said the problem rests with the Biden administration being hostile to oil permits and the construction of new pipelines such as the Keystone XL. Democrats have countered that the country needs to move to renewable energy such as wind and solar that could reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and Russian President Vladimir Putin's leverage. ""I think the administration’s anti-fossil fuel views are sort of like a religion,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told Punchbowl News in a Thursday interview. ""They’re kind of unconnected with the needs of not only our country but the world. This policy is driven by the hard left, which the president almost never crosses. And, until that policy changes, we’re gonna have a problem.” Oil producers have been more focused on meeting the needs of investors than consumers, according to a survey released last week by the Dallas Federal Reserve. About 59% of the executives surveyed said investor pressure to preserve “capital discipline” amid high prices was the reason they weren’t pumping more, while fewer than 10% blamed government regulation. The steady release from the reserves would be a meaningful sum and come near to closing the domestic production gap relative to February 2020, before the coronavirus caused a steep decline in oil output. The Biden administration in November announced the release of 50 million barrels from the strategic reserve in coordination with other countries. And after the Russia-Ukraine war began, the U.S. and 30 other countries agreed to an additional release of 60 million barrels from reserves, with half of the total coming from the U.S. According to the Department of Energy, which manages it, more than 568 million barrels of oil were held in the reserve as of March 25. News of the administration’s planning was first reported by Bloomberg. ——— Associated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.",9
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appealed directly to Australian lawmakers for more help in its war against Russia including armored vehicles and tougher sanctions 'They are fighting our war': Former US ambassador to Ukraine CANBERRA, Australia -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed directly to Australian lawmakers Thursday for more help in its war against Russia, including armored vehicles and tougher sanctions. Zelenskyy has been tailoring his message to individual countries through video appeals like the one shown to legislators in the Australian Parliament. Lawmakers gave him standing ovation at the start and end of his 16-minute address. He called for Russian vessels to be banned from international ports. “We need more sanctions against Russia, powerful sanctions until they stop blackmailing other countries with their nuclear missiles,” Zelenskyy said through an interpreter. Zelenskyy specifically asked for Australian-manufactured Bushmaster four-wheel-drive armored vehicles. “You have very good armed personnel vehicles, Bushmasters, that could help Ukraine substantially, and other pieces of equipment,” Zelenskyy said. While the Ukrainian capital Kyiv was 15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles) from the Australian capital Canberra, Zelenskyy said Australia was not safe from the conflict which threatened to escalate into a nuclear war. He suggested that a Russian victory over Ukraine would embolden China to declare war on Taiwan. “The most terrible thing is that if we don’t stop Russia now, if we don’t hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world who are looking forward to similar wars against their neighbors will decide that such things are possible for them as well,” Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy also said Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Moscow had been punished for the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in Ukraine. Two weeks ago, the Australian and Dutch governments launched a legal case against Russia at the International Civil Aviation Organization to hold Moscow accountable for its alleged role in the missile strike that killed all 298 people on board. Of the victims, 196 were Dutch citizens and 38 were Australian residents. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier told the president that Australia would provide additional military assistance including tactical decoys, unmanned aerial and unmanned ground systems, rations and medical supplies. He later said the additional help would cost 25 million Australian dollars ($19 million). “You have our prayers, but you also have our weapons, our humanitarian aid, our sanctions against those who seek to deny your freedom and you even have our coal,” Morrison said. Australia has already promised or provided Ukraine with AU$91 million ($68 million) in military assistance, AU$65 million ($49 million) in humanitarian help and 70,000 metric tons (77,200 U.S. tons) of coal. Earlier Thursday, the government announced Australia was imposing an additional 35% tariff on all imports from Russia and Belarus starting April 25. Oil and energy imports from Russia will be banned from that date. Exports to Russia of Australian aluminum ore will also be banned. Sanctions have been imposed on more than 500 individuals and entities in Russia and Belarus. The sanctions cover 80% of the Russian banking sector and all government entities that handle Russian sovereign debt. Jeremy Fleming, who heads Britain’s electronic spy agency Government Communications Headquarters, used a speech in Canberra on Thursday to praise Zelenskyy’s “information operation.” Fleming said Zelenskyy had been highly effective at countering Russia’s massive disinformation drive spreading propaganda about the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin had apparently “massively misjudged” the invasion, he said. “We’ve seen Russian soldiers, short of weapons and morale, refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” Fleming said.",6
"Ukrainian authorities at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant say Russian forces have left the damaged plant KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian troops handed control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant back to the Ukrainians and left the heavily contaminated site early Friday, more than a month after taking it over, Ukrainian authorities said, as fighting raged on the outskirts of Kyiv and other fronts. Ukraine's state power company, Energoatom, said the pullout at Chernobyl came after soldiers received “significant doses"" of radiation from digging trenches in the forest in the exclusion zone around the closed plant. But there was no independent confirmation of that. The withdrawal took place amid growing indications the Kremlin is using talk of de-escalation in Ukraine as cover while regrouping, resupplying its forces and redeploying them for a stepped-up offensive in the eastern part of the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian withdrawals from the north and center of the country were just a military tactic and that the forces are building up for new powerful attacks in the southeast. “We know their intentions,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. “We know that they are moving away from those areas where we hit them in order to focus on other, very important ones where it may be difficult for us.” “There will be battles ahead,” he added. Meanwhile, a convoy of 45 buses headed to Mariupol in another bid to evacuate people from the besieged port city after the Russian military agreed to a limited cease-fire in the area. But Russian forces blocked the buses, and only 631 people were able to get out of the city in private cars, according to the Ukrainian government. Twelve Ukrainian buses were able to deliver 14 tons of food and medical supplies to Mariupol, but the aid was seized by Russian troops, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said late Thursday. The city has been the scene of some of the worst suffering of the war. Tens of thousands have managed to get out of Mariupol in the past few weeks by way of humanitarian corridors, reducing its population from a prewar 430,000 to an estimated 100,000 as of last week, but other relief efforts have been thwarted by continued Russian attacks. A new round of talks was scheduled for Friday, five weeks into the war that has left thousands dead and driven 4 million Ukrainians from the country. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it had been informed by Ukraine that the Russian forces at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster had transferred control of it in writing to the Ukrainians. The last Russian troops left the Chernobyl plant early Friday, the Ukrainian government agency responsible for the exclusion zone said. Energoatom gave no details on the condition of the soldiers it said were exposed to radiation and did not say how many were affected. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, and the IAEA said it had not been able to confirm the reports of Russian troops receiving high doses. It said it was seeking more information. Russian forces seized the Chernobyl site in the opening stages of the Feb. 24 invasion, raising fears that they would cause damage or disruption that could spread radiation. The workforce at the site oversees the safe storage of spent fuel rods and the concrete-entombed ruins of the reactor that exploded in 1986. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said it “seems unlikely"" a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but it was impossible to know for sure without more details. He said contaminated material was probably buried or covered with new topsoil during the cleanup of Chernobyl, and some soldiers may have been exposed to a “hot spot” of radiation while digging. Others may have assumed they were at risk too, he said. Early this week, the Russians said they would significantly scale back military operations in areas around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv to increase trust between the two sides and help negotiations along. But in the Kyiv suburbs, regional governor Oleksandr Palviuk said on social media Thursday that Russian forces shelled Irpin and Makariv and that there were battles around Hostomel. Pavliuk said there were Ukrainian counterattacks and some Russian withdrawals around the suburb of Brovary to the east. Chernihiv came under attack as well. At least one person was killed and four were wounded in the Russian shelling of a humanitarian convoy of buses sent to Chernihiv to evacuate residents cut off from food, water and other supplies, said Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Lyudmyla Denisova Ukraine also reported Russian artillery barrages in and around the northeastern city of Kharkiv. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said intelligence indicates Russia is not scaling back its military operations in Ukraine but is instead trying to regroup, resupply its forces and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas. “Russia has repeatedly lied about its intentions,” Stoltenberg said. At the same time, he said, pressure is being kept up on Kyiv and other cities, and “we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering.” The Donbas is the predominantly Russian-speaking industrial region where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. In the past few days, the Kremlin, in a seeming shift in its war aims, said that its “main goal” now is gaining control of the Donbas, which consists of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including Mariupol. The top rebel leader in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, issued an order to set up a rival city government for Mariupol, according to Russian state news agencies, in a sign of Russian intent to hold and administer the city. With talks set to resume between Ukraine and Russia via video, there seemed little faith that the two sides would resolve the conflict any time soon. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that conditions weren’t yet “ripe” for a cease-fire and that he wasn’t ready for a meeting with Zelenskyy until negotiators do more work, Italian Premier Mario Draghi said after a telephone conversation with the Russian leader. In other developments, Ukraine’s emergency services said the death toll had risen to 20 in a Russian missile strike Tuesday on a government administration building in the southern city of Mykolaiv. As Western officials search for clues about what Russia's next move might be, a top British intelligence official said demoralized Russian soldiers in Ukraine are refusing to carry out orders and sabotaging their equipment and had accidentally shot down their own aircraft. In a speech in Australia, Jeremy Fleming, head of the GCHQ electronic spy agency, said Putin had apparently “massively misjudged” the invasion. The Pentagon reported Thursday that an initial half-dozen shipments of weapons and other security assistance from the U.S. have reached Ukraine as part of an $800 million aid package President Joe Biden approved this month. The shipments included Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, body armor, medical supplies and other materials, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the war is going because they are afraid to tell him the truth. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the U.S. is wrong and that “neither the State Department nor the Pentagon possesses the real information about what is happening in the Kremlin.” ——— Karmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

"Investigators are looking into the rally that preceded the Capitol attack. Capitol insurrection: Tracking the attack 1 year later The Department of Justice is expanding its criminal probe into the events of Jan. 6 to include preparations for the rally that preceded the storming of the U.S. Capitol, as well as the financing for the event, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. Over the past two months, grand jury subpoenas have been sent to those who assisted in the organizing and planning of former President Donald Trump's ""Save America"" rally on the Ellipse near the White House, the sources said. The news of the expanding probe was first reported by the Washington Post. The subpoenas to individuals with knowledge of the event are expansive, the sources said. Prosecutors are seeking multiple records and documents related to the rally, including text messages and emails, as well as potential communications with other individuals regarding the logistics of the event. Officials with the Department of Justice declined to comment to ABC News. The subpoenas are not indicative of wrongdoing, and one source said some subpoenas were sent with the clear indication that the request was for witness testimony and cooperation. ""In circumstances like those of Jan. 6, a full accounting does not suddenly materialize. To ensure that all those criminally responsible are held accountable, we must collect the evidence,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5, one year after the Capitol attack.

The facts tell us where to go next,"" Garland said.",9
"When Will Smith slapped Chris Rock over an Oscars ceremony punchline, other comedians felt the sting When Will Smith slapped Chris Rock over an Oscars ceremony punchline, other comedians felt the sting. “I know Chris and I know what it’s like to be on a stage in front of an audience that doesn’t like your material,” said stand-up comedian Judy Gold. “But to be physically assaulted, that’s a whole other thing. It felt like every comedian was smacked across the face. It really felt like that.” Smith's act comes during a stressful time for comedy. While boundaries for humor constantly shift — think George Carlin’s 1972 monologue on seven so-called ""dirty words"" banned by TV — comics say they have felt increased pushback from audiences and society. Comedy great Dave Chappelle drew sharp criticism last year for what some deemed anti-transgender humor in his Netflix special “The Closer."" Kathy Griffin's career was derailed in 2017 when she was photographed holding a mock-up of former President Donald Trump's head. Some comedians expressed concern that Smith's behavior might embolden other displeased audience members. “No one went up to Chris Rock and said, ‘Are you OK?’"" Sheryl Underwood, co-host of “The Talk,” said on the show Tuesday. “I’m going to say this as a comic, I am afraid now to get on a stage, because in my third show, when everyone’s been drinking, if you don’t like my joke, do you now believe that you can get up and slap me? There’s got to be accountability quicker.” Griffin tweeted that “now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters.” “Which is the worst crime here?” veteran comedian Gilbert Gottfried said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Chris Rock being physically assaulted? Or Chris Rock making a joke? That's it, pure and simple. He made a joke.” Dean Obeidallah, a lawyer and stand-up comic who hosts a show on the SiriusXM Progress channel, said there is never “a place for a violent response to a joke” but doubted there would be copycat behavior. In his time in comedy clubs, he’s seen yelling, screaming and, once, a glass thrown at somebody. But he's never seen a punch thrown, nor a comedian slapped. “If someone were to strike a comedian, they’re going to be prosecuted criminally. They don’t have the privilege that Will Smith has,” Obeidallah said. The Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday that it was aware of the incident, but Rock had declined to file a police report. Smith stayed through the rest of the ceremony Sunday and received the best-actor Oscar. Gold said she’s been confronted but never struck, and she knows other female comedians have faced difficult circumstances. “People have been getting on stage, people have thrown things,” she said. Comedian-actor Yamaneika Saunders calls Smith’s behavior upsetting and Sunday a sad day for ”two beloved Black men in entertainment.” She also views what happened through the lens of a ""Black woman in comedy.'' “I'm constantly being threatened....by some man who doesn’t like some (expletive) I said about being a woman, some white guy who doesn’t like some (expletive) I said about being Black,” she said. Insult humor isn't new to high-profile ceremonies, which call on comics to liven up what can be tedious events. Ricky Gervais made a meal of celebrities at successive Golden Globe ceremonies, and they grin — or grimace — and bear it. The most famous bad sport: Trump at the 2011 White House correspondents' dinner, where he sat stone-faced during then-President Barack Obama's extended ribbing of him. Rock wasn't the first to tweak Smith or wife Jada Pinkett Smith at Sunday's Oscars. Ceremony co-host Regina Hall made what appeared to be a veiled joke about their marriage in trying, unsuccessfully, to draw Smith into a comedy bit. Rock’s wisecrack was targeted at Pinkett Smith. “Jada, I love you. ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it,” the comedian said to Pinkett Smith, whose close-shaven head looked similar to Demi Moore's in the 1997 movie. Whether Rock was aware that she has a hair-loss condition, alopecia, is unknown, but Smith reacted with the smack and an angry warning to “keep my wife’s name out your (expletive) mouth!” A tearful Smith later accepted the top acting award for “King Richard,"" his somewhat remorseful speech eliciting a standing ovation from the Dolby Theatre crowd. The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has since condemned Smith's attack and said it's reviewing the matter. Whatever the result, his actions indelibly marred the ceremony and ignited discussions about violence, toxic masculinity and the advantages of fame. Smith, who'd conspicuously left Rock out of his remarks Sunday, apologized to the comic and decried “violence in all of its forms” in a statement the next day issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. Pinkett Smith's first public comment came in an Instagram post in which she said, “This is a season for healing and I’m here for it."" Rock referred briefly to the slap at a comedy show Wednesday in Boston, saying he was “still kind of processing what happened.” He appeared to become emotional as the audience gave him several standing ovations. Whatever pushback comedians may encounter on stage, verbal or physical, they have to guard against censoring themselves to avoid it — and they will, said Obeidallah: ""They shouldn’t change, and there’s nothing about this that tells me that they will change.” They can't because their role goes beyond providing laughs, as comedians see it. “We are the truth tellers. We speak truth to power,” said Gold, author of the 2020 book, “Yes, I Can Say That: When They Come for the Comedians, We Are All in Trouble.” Gottfried cites a favorite Carlin quote — “It's the duty of the comedian to find out where the line is drawn and cross it deliberately"" — and can't resist serving up a punchline. “If Will Smith is reading this, dear God, please don’t come to my shows,” he said. —- AP Television Writer Lynn Elber reported from Los Angeles, AP Media Writer David Bauder from New York.",4
"President Joe Biden has marked Transgender Day of Visibility by denouncing what he's calling “hateful bills” being passed at the state level WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden marked Transgender Day of Visibility on Thursday by denouncing “hateful bills” being passed at the state level as the White House played host to “Jeopardy!” champion Amy Schneider, the first openly transgender winner on the popular quiz show. Schneider met with second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who joined Rachel Levine, the assistant health secretary and the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the Senate, for a conversation with transgender kids and their parents. Schneider used the moment in the Washington spotlight to speak out against bills affecting transgender people. “They’re really scary and some of them in particular that are denying medical services to trans youth, those are, those are lifesaving medical treatments,"" Schneider told reporters. ""These bills will cause the deaths of children and that’s really sad to me and it’s really frightening.” Biden, in a brief video message, said that “the onslaught of anti-transgender state laws attacking you and your families is simply wrong.” The president said his administration ""is standing up for you against all these hateful bills. And we’re committed to advancing transgender equality in the classroom, on the playing field, at work, in our military and our housing and health care systems.” The administration announced several actions to make the federal government more inclusive for transgender people and said the Health and Human Services Department will be the first agency to fly a trans pride flag.. The steps come as Republican leaders have advanced state measures targeting transgender people as part of a broader push to stoke culture wars heading into a critical election season. The administration said the federal government will become more inclusive for transgender people, including through the use of a new “X” gender marker on U.S. passport applications, beginning on April 11, and new Transportation Security Administration scanners that are gender-neutral. It is working to expand the availability of the “X” gender marker to airlines and federal travel programs and will make it easier for transgender people to change their gender information in Social Security Administration records. Visitors to the White House complex soon will also be able to choose an “X” gender marker option in the White House Worker and Visitor Entry System, which is used to conduct screening background checks. At airports, changes will be made to screening scanners along with the introduction of the use of an “X” for travelers going through Precheck who do not identify as male or female. Transportation Security Administration agents will receive new instructions on how to make screening procedures less invasive and will work with airlines to promote acceptance of the “X” gender marker. “Jeopardy!” star Schneider spoke of “being a trans person out there that isn’t monstrous and isn’t threatening and is just a normal person, like we all are,” and said ""the more that people like me can be seen, the harder it is to sustain the myths that are ... kind of driving a lot of this hate and fear.” In his video, Biden said there is work still to be done to end “the epidemic of violence against transgender women of color and girls of color” and to ensure that transgender seniors “can age with dignity.” He called anew on Congress to pass the Equality Act to help transgender people around the world “live free from discrimination and violence.” Biden tried to reassure any transgender person who is struggling, telling them to remember that “you're not alone.” “You’re so brave. You belong. And we have your back,” Biden said. The administration’s actions follow recent steps at the state level to limit activity by transgender people. At least 10 states have banned transgender athletes from participating in sports at all levels in a way that is consistent with their gender identity. In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is seeking reelection, has ordered the state’s child welfare agency to probe reports of gender-confirming care for kids as abuse. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who is running for reelection and considering a 2024 presidential bid, on Monday signed into law a measure that bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. The law has drawn intense national scrutiny from critics who argue it marginalizes LGBTQ people. Republicans and advocates of the law argue that discussion of these topics should be between parents and their children. ——— Associated Press writers Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, and Colleen Long and Ben Fox contributed to this report.",1
"The U.S. says Putin is not getting full information from his advisers. Ukrainian families seek asylum in US The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 36: Russians being hunted as they withdraw from Kyiv area The U.S. continues to see roughly 20% of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv repositioning away from the capital, the official said. And Ukrainian forces are attacking these troops as they withdraw from the area. ""As these forces begin to reposition, the Ukrainians are moving against them,"" the official said. Most of the Russian forces that are repositioning were located to the north and northwest of Kyiv. Most notably, they seem to have abandoned Hostomel airport, which has been a site of intense fighting at various points since the beginning of the invasion. ""We believe that they have very likely abandoned Hostomel airfield,"" the official said. Although some troops are repositioning, long-range strikes on Kyiv continue. ""Despite the rhetoric of de-escalation, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv,"" the official said. Shifting focus to Donbas ""This repositioning that they're doing around Kyiv and other places in the north, and this reprioritization on the Donbas, clearly indicates that they know they have failed to take the capital city, that they know they have been under increased pressure elsewhere around the country,"" the official said. While Russia might be dedicating more forces to taking control of the Donbas region, the Ukrainians are primed to make it a tough fight. ""The Ukrainians know the territory very, very well. They have a lot of forces still there, and they're absolutely fighting very hard for that area, as they have over the last eight years,"" the official said. ""So just because they're going to prioritize it and put more force there or more energy there doesn't mean it's going to be easy for them."" Russian ships can hit Donbas While there are still no signs of any imminent amphibious landings, Russia has several ships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that could be used to threaten the Donbas region with cruise missiles, the official said. Putin not getting full picture from advisers ""Our assessment is that the planning for this war was done with a very small circle of people, and that Mr. Putin's advisers do not count many. And, you know, our assessment is that they have not been completely honest with him about how it's going,"" the official said. The official said Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept to a ""very, very close circle,"" a leadership style that inherently limits access to information. ""I can't account for the fact that the people advising him have chosen to obstruct certain information or omit certain information. All we can say is we don't believe that he has been getting the full picture,"" the official said. Odesa under blockade ""We know that the Russians have continued to blockade Odesa,"" the official said. ""So obviously it's having it's having an economic impact there."" Kherson contested ""We assess that they're still fighting over Kherson. We know that the Russians are in the city, but we aren't prepared to call it for one side or the other at this point. I mean, it had been in Russian control, but the Ukrainians are attempting to retake Kherson, so it's still being fought over,"" the official said. Bombardment of Mariupol continues ""I don't have an update on the degree to which a cease-fire is being applied in Mariupol. What I try to give you is what we've seen, you know, in the last 24 hours since we last talked, and we have continued to see Mariupol will come under airstrikes,"" the official said.",6
"Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia will send armored Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically asked for them while appealing to Australian lawmakers for more help in Ukraine’s war against Russia Trans Ukrainians fleeing hate, war CANBERRA, Australia -- Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday that Australia will send armored Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically asked for them while appealing to Australian lawmakers for more help in Ukraine's war against Russia. Zelenskyy addressed the Australian Parliament on Thursday and asked for the Australian-made, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Morrison told reporters the vehicles will be flown over on Boeing C-17 Globemaster transport planes. He didn’t specify how many would be sent or when. “We’re not just sending our prayers, we are sending our guns, we’re sending our munitions, we’re sending our humanitarian aid, we’re sending all of this, our body armor, all of these things and we’re going to be sending our armored vehicles, our Bushmasters, as well,” Morrison said. Zelenskyy has been tailoring his message to individual countries through video appeals like the one shown to legislators in the Australian Parliament. Lawmakers gave him standing ovation at the start and end of his 16-minute address. Zelenskyy also called for tougher sanctions and for Russian vessels to be banned from international ports. “We need more sanctions against Russia, powerful sanctions until they stop blackmailing other countries with their nuclear missiles,” Zelenskyy said through an interpreter. Zelenskyy specifically asked for Bushmaster vehicles. “You have very good armed personnel vehicles, Bushmasters, that could help Ukraine substantially, and other pieces of equipment,” Zelenskyy said. While the Ukrainian capital Kyiv is 15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles) from the Australian capital Canberra, Zelenskyy said Australia was not safe from the conflict which threatened to escalate into a nuclear war. He suggested that a Russian victory over Ukraine would embolden China to declare war on Taiwan. “The most terrible thing is that if we don’t stop Russia now, if we don’t hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world who are looking forward to similar wars against their neighbors will decide that such things are possible for them as well,” Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy also said Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Moscow had been punished for the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane in Ukraine. Two weeks ago, the Australian and Dutch governments launched a legal case against Russia at the International Civil Aviation Organization to hold Moscow accountable for its alleged role in the missile strike that killed all 298 people on MH17. Of the victims, 196 were Dutch citizens and 38 were Australian residents. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier told the president that Australia would provide additional military assistance including tactical decoys, unmanned aerial and unmanned ground systems, rations and medical supplies. He later said the additional help would cost 25 million Australian dollars ($19 million). “You have our prayers, but you also have our weapons, our humanitarian aid, our sanctions against those who seek to deny your freedom and you even have our coal,” Morrison said. Australia has already promised or provided Ukraine with AU$91 million ($68 million) in military assistance, AU$65 million ($49 million) in humanitarian help and 70,000 metric tons (77,200 U.S. tons) of coal. Earlier Thursday, the government announced Australia was imposing an additional 35% tariff on all imports from Russia and Belarus starting April 25. Oil and energy imports from Russia will be banned from that date. Exports to Russia of Australian aluminum ore will also be banned. Sanctions have been imposed on more than 500 individuals and entities in Russia and Belarus. The sanctions cover 80% of the Russian banking sector and all government entities that handle Russian sovereign debt. ——— Associated Press journalist Nick Perry contributed to this report from Wellington, New Zealand.",6
"ABC News' Maggie Rulli reports from south of Ukraine's border.  Ukraine's neighbors absorb influx of refugees Our team spent five days tracing the southern border of Ukraine. We drove more than 650 long miles through the big open, empty lands and packed small towns of Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, countries that have welcomed more than 1 million people fleeing the war. On the way, we found countless individual stories of horror, perseverance and kindness -- and a group of unique countries giving back any way they can, while living with their own fears that they could be next. Moldova in some ways felt the most like Ukraine. The only other non-NATO, non-EU country along the border, Moldova and Ukraine are also two of the poorest countries in Europe. Many families live across the border here, and both countries have lost territory to Russian aggression in the past. There’s a kinship you can feel between the countries, with so many people we meet here calling Ukrainians “their neighbors, their brothers.” Despite few resources and crushing numbers, Moldovans are doing whatever they can to help. Since the start of the war, more than 380,000 people have fled through the country, more than 15% of the country’s entire population and the most per capita of any other country. We discovered an old movie theater in the country’s capital of Chisinau that had been left standing empty for four years, now converted into a shelter for up to 200 people. The walls were crumbling, but the place had brand new mattresses on the floor. The makeshift home meant a place to stay for Irina and her four-year-old son, Arcadyi. Irina tells us she didn’t want to leave Odessa. Her other son turned 18 in October and since he is now old enough to fight, he isn’t allowed to leave Ukraine. But she says he told her she had to go, she had to save his little brother. She had to make sure at least one son survived this war. She chose to come here to Moldova, because it was the closest that she could stay to her other son. It’s something we hear from many refugees -- the desire to stay as close to home as they can. But Moldova is complicated. It's close to Ukraine, but also to Russia. There are pro-Russian parties in the government and in some groups in town. While we’re at the shelter, a tractor pulls up to drop off supplies. On it -- a large Z, a symbol that’s now become synonymous with Putin’s forces in Russia and is often seen on the tanks there. A tractor with support for Russia, dropping off items that locals have donated to help Ukrainians feeling the Russian attack? Nothing about the scene makes sense, but it’s perhaps the best explanation of life in Moldova. Close proximity to Russia means some people befriend the country, and many are worried that they could be invaded next. We found a similar fear in Romania. On my way out of the region, we flew out of a small airport close to the border. A security guard there asked us what it was like in Ukraine. I asked if he had family there. He said, “No, I’m just worried that Putin will come after us next.” Romania is also a NATO and European Union member. Attacking it would have worldwide implications. But even with these assurances, people here still live in fear. Romania has the largest border with Ukraine of any EU country. Driving along the winding road as it hugs the dividing line between the two countries, we see mostly vast, empty miles. It makes sense that it’s a well-known route for illegal crossings. That could mean men trying to flee Ukraine. We see at least one man sitting with police on the side of the road. But at official crossings, it is almost exclusively women and children. In Siret, Romania’s busiest border crossing, we meet Elenea and her young daughter Katya just moments after they cross. The mother tells us they’re from Kiev and lived right by the television tower that was bombed recently. They wanted to stay, but when one of Katya’s classmates died, Elenea knew she had to leave. We’re there as she FaceTimes her husband to let him know they made it across safely. He had to stay behind to fight. Working in this job, you’re used to being with people during the worst and often hardest moments of their lives. But witnessing this intimate moment broke me. A simple check in between husband and wife, now torn apart by war. Their daughter now asking when she would be able to see her dad again. A heartbreak so big, you could see it. Sadly, their story isn’t uncommon. We met so many families forced to separate, unsure when, or if, they will ever be together again. And as war rages on, the numbers of those fleeing only keep increasing. We hear rumblings from NGOs and volunteers, even other refugees, about hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians waiting just on the other side of the border. People want to stay in Ukraine, but may have to flee as the fighting moves west. We ask for numbers of those at the border, but no one is able to tell us for certain. While everyone says they want to remain open to refugees, resources are already stretched thin. If one million people turns into 2 or 3 million, there are concerns about how these countries can keep up. For now, people are stepping up however they can. In Slovakia, we meet Father Pavel Novack who leads a congregation at a small church less than a mile from the border. He helped turn a school nearby into a shelter, one of 24 in this small region. Everything inside is donated from the community. He’s already helped more than 100 refugees, and on the day we visit there are 34 people living inside. Entire groups of families and friends share one room, but always with a roof, food and plenty of hope to go around. Father Pavel says refugees of all faiths are welcome. He shows us his church and tells us that in Orthodox Christianity the sermons are always sung, and as the sun sets outside he begins to pray. After a day of running around chasing stories and driving hundreds of miles, his song stopped our whole crew and forced us to stand still. His voice filled the tiny house of worship with a calmness we hadn’t felt in days. In that brief moment, the war, the heartache, the violence all felt far away. It’s these moments that will stick with me. Of people sacrificing everything to save their families. Of people giving everything of what little they have to help others. Of people trying to find joy even in the darkest moments of war. On our final day, we visited a small park in Moldova and stumbled into a group of older people dancing. As Moldovan music blasted on speakers and elderly couples held hands and shouted in delight, you could feel their joy from across the park. With war just a few dozen miles from where they stood, and with refugees fleeing unthinkable violence, this group remembered to dance. We watched this moment of joy, of life lived well, and were reminded what’s worth fighting for.",6
"The former governor will run for the seat vacated by Don Young. Sarah Palin running for Congress Former GOP vice president candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will run for Alaska’s at-large Congress seat vacated by the late Rep. Don Young, she announced on her Facebook page Friday. ""Today I’m announcing my candidacy for the U.S. House seat representing Alaska,"" Palin wrote. ""Public service is a calling, and I would be honored to represent the men and women of Alaska in Congress, just as Rep. Young did for 49 years."" Young died on March 18 at 88 years old after losing consciousness on a flight to Seattle returning home to Alaska. He was the ""dean of the House"" as the longest-serving representative. Tiffany Montemayor, public relations manager at the Alaska Division of Elections, confirmed to ABC News that Palin had filed to run on Friday afternoon. The deadline to file was 5 p.m. Friday. The primary will be held June 11 with the special election Aug. 16. Palin, 58, resigned as governor in 2009, but helped mainstream the populist strain of GOP politics later embraced by former President Donald Trump. ""America is at a tipping point. As I’ve watched the far left destroy the country, I knew I had to step up and join the fight,"" Palin wrote. ""The people of the great State of Alaska, like others all over the country, are struggling with out-of-control inflation, empty shelves, and gas prices that are among the highest in the world."" She continued, ""We need energy security for this country, and Alaska can help provide that -- but only if the federal government gets out of the way and lets the free market do what it does best."" She was a surprise choice as running mate for the late Sen. John McCain when he ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008. Palin has stayed in the public eye in the 13 years since she stepped down as governor though she hasn't run for office since then. She released two books, ""Going Rogue"" and ""America by Heart,"" appeared for years as a political commentator on Fox News and starred on the TLC reality series ""Sarah Palin's Alaska."" She was also a contestant on Fox's ""The Masked Singer"" in 2020. She was in the news last month when a judge in New York tossed a libel lawsuit she had filed against The New York Times in 2017 saying the newspaper deliberately ruined her burgeoning career as a political commentator and consultant by publishing an erroneous editorial. The judge said she had not proven ""actual malice"" on behalf of the paper. He allowed the jury to still reach a verdict, but they also ruled in favor of the newspaper.

"As the Russian army bogs down in Ukraine, many youths back home feel increasingly jittery about the prospect of being drafted and sent into combat On Location: April 6, 2022 As Moscow's forces bog down in Ukraine, many young Russians of draft age are increasingly jittery about the prospect of being sent into combat. Making those fears particularly acute is an annual spring conscription that began Friday and aims to round up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu pledged at a meeting of the military brass this week that the new recruits won't be sent to front lines or “hot spots.” But the statement was met with skepticism by many in Russia who remember the separatist wars in the southern republic of Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s, when thousands of poorly trained young men were killed. “I don't trust them when they say they won't send conscripts into combat. They lie all the time,” said Vladislav, a 22-year-old who is completing his studies and fears he could face the draft immediately after graduation. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing reprisals. All Russian men ages 18 to 27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or get deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities. Even as President Vladimir Putin and his officials say that conscripts aren’t involved in what Russian authorities call “the special military operation in Ukraine,” many appeared to have been taken prisoner during its initial days. Videos emerged from Ukraine of captured Russians, some being shown calling their parents, and were put on social media. The mother of one of the prisoners said she recognized her 20-year-old draftee son in a video even though he was shown blindfolded. “I recognized him by his lips, by his chin. You know, I would have recognized him by his fingers,” said the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Lyubov, for security reasons. ""I breastfed him. I raised him.” The Defense Ministry was forced to walk back its statements and acknowledge that some conscripts were sent to Ukraine “by mistake” and were taken prisoner while serving with a supply unit away from the front. There have been allegations that before the invasion, some conscripts were forced to sign military contracts that allowed them to be sent into combat — duty that is normally reserved only for volunteers in the army. Some of the captured soldiers said they were told by their commanding officers that they were going to a military exercise but suddenly found themselves fighting in Ukraine. Lyudmila Narusova, a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament, spoke in early March about an entire company of 100 men who were forced to sign such contracts and were sent into the combat zone — and only four survived. Military officials did not comment on her allegation. Svetlana Agapitova, the human rights commissioner in St. Petersburg, said Wednesday that relatives of seven soldiers had written to her to complain the men had been forced to sign contracts and sent to Ukraine against their will. She said two of them already had been brought back to Russia. In recent years, the Kremlin has emphasized increasing the share of volunteer contract soldiers as it sought to modernize the army and improve its readiness. The force of 1 million now has over 400,000 contract soldiers, including 147,000 in the infantry. If the war drags on, those numbers could be insufficient to sustain the operations. The Kremlin could eventually face a choice: Keep fighting with a limited number of troops and see the offensive stall, or try to replenish the ranks with a broader draft and risk public outrage that could fuel anti-draft sentiment and destabilize the political situation. Such a scenario occurred during the fighting in Chechnya. Dmitry, a 25-year-old IT expert, has a deferment that should keep him out of the draft for medical reasons. But he's still nervous like many others, fearing authorities could abruptly waive some deferments to bolster the military. “I hate the war. I think it's a total disaster,” said Dmitry, who also asked that he not be identified by has last name, fearing reprisals. “I fear that the government could change the rules and I could face the draft. They also were saying for months that they wouldn’t attack Ukraine, so why should I trust what they say about the draft now?” Proposed legislation would facilitate the draft by allowing military recruiters to call up conscripts more easily, but the bill has been put on hold for now. Still, it added to the public’s anxiety. Alexei Tabalov, a lawyer who advises conscripts, said medical panels at recruitment offices often admit youths who should be exempt from service because of illness. Now, he added, their attitudes could grow even tougher. “It's quite probable that doctors may shut their eyes to conscripts' illnesses and declare them fit for military duty,” Tabalov said. In addition to lowering the medical standard for draftees, there are fears that the government could try to impose some sort of martial law that would ban Russian men from leaving the country and, like Ukraine, force them to fight. “We have received a lot of calls from people fearing mobilization,” Tabalov said. “People now are afraid of everything in this situation. No one even thought before about the need to analyze the law on mobilization.” The Kremlin has strongly denied any such plans, and military officials insist the army has enough contract soldiers to serve in Ukraine. Still, many Russians remain skeptical of the officials' denials, given their track record. “What kind of trust could there be if Putin says one day that conscripts will not be sent there ... and then the Defense Ministry recognizes that they were there?” Tabalov asked. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Russian parents not to allow their sons to be drafted. “We do not need new dead people here,” he said in his nighttime video address, switching from Ukrainian into Russian. “Take care of your children so they do not become villains. Do not send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. At home.” An existing law allows for a 21-month alternative civil service in hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities for those who view military duty as incompatible with their beliefs, but military conscription offices often broadly ignore requests for such service. After the war began, Tabalov said his group saw a large increase in inquiries about the alternative service law, which is vaguely phrased and allows military officials to easily turn down applications. “We are worried that in the current militarist mood, military conscription offices can take a tougher attitude and reject appeals for the alternative civil service,” he said. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",7
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is warning his people that retreating Russian forces are creating “a complete disaster” outside the capital as they leave behind many mines, even around homes and corpses KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned his people early Saturday that retreating Russian forces were creating “a complete disaster” outside the capital as they leave mines across “the whole territory,” even around homes and corpses. He issued the warning as the humanitarian crisis in the encircled city of Mariupol deepened, with Russian forces blocking evacuation operations for the second day in a row, and the Kremlin accused the Ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on Russian soil. Ukraine denied responsibility for the fiery blast, but if Moscow’s claim is confirmed, it would be the war’s first known attack in which Ukrainian aircraft penetrated Russian airspace. “Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, five weeks after Moscow began sending upwards of 150,000 of its own troops across Ukraine’s border. Russia continued withdrawing some of its ground forces from areas around Kyiv after saying earlier this week it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv. “They are mining the whole territory. They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. “There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.” He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed. While the Russians kept up their bombardment around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops exploited the pullback on the ground by mounting counterattacks and retaking a number of towns and villages. Still, Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shifting its troops to the country’s east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensified assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country's east, which includes Mariupol. Zelenskyy warned of difficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops. “We are preparing for an even more active defense,” he said. He did not say anything about the latest round of talks, which took place Friday by video. At a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join NATO and declare itself neutral — Moscow’s chief demand — in return for security guarantees from several other countries. The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million refugees from Ukraine. Mariupol, the shattered and besieged southern port city, has seen some of the worst suffering of the war. Its capture would be a major prize for Russian President Vladimir Putin, giving his country an unbroken land bridge to Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014. Mariupol's fate could determine the course of the negotiations to end the war, said Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Ukrainian think tank Penta. “Mariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance,"" Fesenko said, “and without its conquest, Putin cannot sit down at the negotiating table.” The fall of Mariupol, he said, “will open the way to a peace agreement.” On Friday, the International Committee for the Red Cross said it was unable to carry out an operation to bring civilians out of Mariupol by bus. It said a team had been on its way but had to turn back. City authorities said the Russians were blocking access to Mariupol. “We do not see a real desire on the part of the Russians and their satellites to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,” Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. He said Russian forces “are categorically not allowing any humanitarian cargo, even in small amounts, into the city.” Around 100,000 people are believed left in the city, down from a prewar 430,000, and weeks of Russian bombardment and street fighting have caused severe shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine. “We are running out of adjectives to describe the horrors that residents in Mariupol have suffered,” Red Cross spokesperson Ewan Watson said. On Thursday, Russian forces blocked a 45-bus convoy attempting to evacuate people from Mariupol and seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies bound for the city, Ukrainian authorities said. Zelenskyy said more than 3,000 people were able to leave Mariupol on Friday. He said he discussed the humanitarian disaster with French President Emmanuel Macron by telephone and with the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, during her visit to Kyiv. “Europe doesn’t have the right to be silent about what is happening in our Mariupol,” Zelenskyy said. “The whole world should respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.” Elsewhere, at least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late Friday from the Crimean Peninsula at the Odesa region on the Black Sea, regional leader Maksim Marchenko said. The Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles were intended for critical infrastructure but did not hit their targets because of Ukraine’s air-defense forces. It was unclear where they hit. Marchenko said there were casualties, but he did not elaborate. Odesa is Ukraine’s largest port and the headquarters of its navy. As for the fuel depot explosion, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said two Ukrainian helicopter gunships flew in extremely low and attacked the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the Ukraine border. The regional governor said two workers at the depot were wounded, but the Rosneft state oil company denied anyone was hurt. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said on Ukrainian television: “For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality."" In an interview with Fox, Zelenskyy refused to say whether Ukraine launched the attack. Russia has reported cross-border shelling from Ukraine before, including an incident last week that killed a military chaplain, but not an incursion of its airspace. Amid the Russian pullback on the ground and its continued bombardment, Ukraine’s military said it had retaken 29 settlements in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. Russian forces in the northeast also continued to shell Kharkiv, and in the southeast sought to seize the cities of Popasna and Rubizhne as well as Mariupol, the Ukrainian military said. Meanwhile, Russia on Friday began its annual spring conscription, which aimed at rounding up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty. Russian officials say new recruits won’t be sent to the front lines or “hot spots,” but many young Russians are skeptical and fear they will be drawn into the war. On the outskirts of Kyiv, where Russian troops have withdrawn, damaged cars lined the streets of Irpin, a suburban area popular with young families, now in ruins. Emergency workers carried elderly people on stretchers over a wrecked bridge to safety. Three wooden crosses next to a residential building that was damaged in a shelling marked the graves of a mother and son and an unknown man. A resident who gave her name only as Lila said she helped hurriedly bury them on March 5, just before Russian troops moved in. “They were hit with artillery and they were burned alive,” she said. An Irpin resident who gave his name only as Andriy said the Russians packed up their equipment and left on Tuesday. The next day, they shelled the town for close to an hour before Ukrainian soldiers retook it. “I don’t think this is over,” Andriy said. “They will be back.” ——— Karmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

"The European Union is seeking China’s assurances that it won’t assist Russia in circumventing economic sanctions leveled over the invasion of Ukraine On Location: March 31, 2022 BRUSSELS -- Top European Union officials began talks Friday with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, as the 27-nation bloc seeks assurances that Beijing won't help Russia to circumvent economic sanctions leveled over the invasion of Ukraine. The virtual summit will also see European Council President Charles Michel, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell hold talks with Chinese President and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping. Prior to the annual meeting, EU officials said they would also look for signs Beijing is willing to cooperate on bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. Other topics include China’s travel ban on members of the European Parliament; Beijing’s economic boycott of EU member Lithuania over its Taiwan relations; the fate of a stalled investment agreement; and civil and political rights under China’s authoritarian Communist Party regime. The summit takes place amid sharply rising negative sentiment toward China within the bloc, fueled by China's increasingly aggressive foreign policies and trade practices. Beijing has dismissed European criticisms as biased and driven by an anti-China agenda being pursued by its chief global rival, the United States. The war in Ukraine has thrown those differences into stark relief, with the EU rallying to the Ukrainian cause and China refusing to condemn Russia, while repeating Russian disinformation about the war and criticizing punishing economic sanctions brought against Moscow. “We are looking for assurances that China has no intention of providing an economic lifeline or other support to Russia during this war,” an EU official told reporters Thursday, speaking on customary condition of anonymity in line with his institution's rules. At a daily briefing Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that when it came to Ukraine, Beijing would not be forced to “choose a side or adopt a simplistic friend-or-foe approach. We should, in particular, resist the Cold War thinking and bloc confrontation.” He also reiterated China’s opposition to economic sanctions against Russia, saying those would “not help solve problems at all and will even create new problems.” “China disapproves of solving problems through sanctions, and we are even more opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law,” Zhao said. Underlying the EU's expectations for China is the possibility of penalties against Chinese companies that undermine measures taken against Russia. EU officials point out that 13.7% of China’s total trade is done with the 27-nation bloc, and 12% with the United States, compared with just 2.4% with Russia. Officials said they also wish to emphasize the impact the war is having on the availability of fertilizer and global energy and food prices, which are hitting the poorest countries in Africa and the Middle East hardest. The EU also plans to raise China’s trade spat with Lithuania sparked by the Baltic state’s decision to allow Taiwan to open an unofficial representative office in its capital, Vilnius, under the name “Taiwan."" China considers the self-governing island republic part of its territory with no right to independent foreign relations and has frozen trade with Lithuania in retaliation. Beijing also sanctioned some European Union lawmakers last year after the EU, Britain, Canada and the United States launched coordinated sanctions against officials in China over human rights abuses in the far western Xinjiang region. The European Parliament responded by saying it will not ratify a long-awaited business investment deal as long as the sanctions remain in place. Rights groups have also urged the EU to take a more assertive stand with China over repression in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and elsewhere and the persecution of Chinese dissidents including Sakharov Prize winner Ilham Tohti and Chinese-Swedish publisher Gui Minhai. “The EU's foreign policy chief has pointed with alarm to the Chinese government's ‘revisionist campaign' against universal human rights and institutions,"" Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch said in a news release. “Brussels should revise its approach to match the magnitude of that threat,"" Richardson said. ——— Moritsugu reported from Beijing.",6
"Russia’s foreign minister has lauded India for not taking a “one-sided view” as he discussed Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine with his Indian counterpart On Location: March 31, 2022 NEW DELHI -- Russia's foreign minister lauded India for not taking a ""one-sided view"" as he discussed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine with his Indian counterpart on Friday, after Washington urged New Delhi to use its leverage with Russia to end the war. India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in their opening remarks underlined that ties between the two countries have sustained them through difficult times in the past. Jaishankar said India has always been in favor of resolving differences through dialogue and diplomacy and avoided condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lavrov praised India for judging ""the situation in its entirety, not just in a one-sided way."" He expressed hope that mutual respect in search of a balance in ties will prevail in the future. Uninterrupted supply of spare parts for Russian military equipment in India's arsenal, trade and oil payments in roubles, as demanded by Moscow, are expected to be discussed by the two sides. India was Moscow's ally during the Cold War but has since sought to maintain ties with both Russia and Western nations. On Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. expected India would use its relations with Russia to help end the war in Ukraine. “Different countries are going to have their own relationship with the Russian Federation. It’s a fact of history, it’s a fact of geography. That is not something that we are seeking to change,“ Price told reporters in Washington. He said the U.S. is looking for its friends and allies to speak in unison and loudly against the ""unjustified, unprovoked, premeditated Russian aggression.” Experts say up to 60% of Indian defense equipment comes from Russia. New Delhi finds itself in a bind at a time when it is facing a 2-year-old standoff with China along their disputed border, with tens of thousands of soldiers within shooting distance. Twenty Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers died in a clash in 2020. In the early 1990s, about 70% of Indian army weapons, 80% of its air force systems and 85% of its navy platforms were of Soviet origin. India is now reducing its dependency on Russian arms and diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from countries like the United States, Israel, France and Italy. But energy dependency on Russia remains a factor in relations. Last month, state-run Indian Oil Corp. bought 3 million barrels of crude from Russia to secure its needs, resisting Western pressure to avoid such purchases. Jaishankar, who met British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Thursday, defended India’s decision and decried ""what looks almost like a campaign on this issue.” He said the March figures show that Europe bought 15% more oil and gas from Russia than it did in February. ""We get the bulk of our supply from the Middle East. In the past, India bought less than 1% from Russia. When the oil prices go up it is natural for countries to go out to the market and look up for good deals that are good for people,” he said at a meeting of the India-U.K. Strategic Futures Forum. ""I am quite sure that if we wait for two-three months and look at who are the big buyers, I suspect the list will not be vastly different. I suspect we will not be in top 10 on that list.“ The United States, Britain and other Western countries are urging India to avoid buying Russian oil and gas. Indian media reports said Russia was offering a discount on oil purchases of 20% below global benchmark prices.",3
"Jurors will hear closing arguments Friday in the trial of four men accused of a brazen conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer New video emerges of suspects in Whitmer alleged plot Jurors will hear closing arguments Friday in the trial of four men accused of a brazen conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a case built with informants, undercover agents, secret recordings and two people who pleaded guilty and cooperated. Only one defendant, Daniel Harris, chose to testify in his own defense. But his denial of any crime Thursday was met by an aggressive cross-examination in which prosecutors used his own words to show his contempt for Whitmer and even suggestions about how to kill her. Adam Fox, Barry Croft Jr. and Brandon Caserta declined to testify, and defense attorneys called only a few witnesses. The four deny any scheme to get Whitmer at her vacation home in fall 2020, though they were livid with government as well as restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The men were arrested in October 2020 amid talk of raising $4,000 for an explosive that could blow up a bridge and stymie police after a kidnapping, according to trial evidence. Fox twice traveled to northern Michigan to scout the area. Defense attorneys, however, insist they were under the spell of informants and agents who got them to say and do violent, provocative things. Harris repeatedly answered “absolutely not” when asked by his lawyer if he was part of a plot. His testimony was perilous because he exposed himself to numerous challenges by prosecutors who had been offering evidence against the group for days. Harris and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Roth sometimes talked over each other. At one point, Harris snapped, “Next question.” “Everyone can take it down a notch,” U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker said later. Roth confronted Harris with his own chat messages about posing as a pizza deliveryman and killing Whitmer at her door. He reminded Harris, a former Marine, that he worked with explosives while training with the group, especially in Luther, Michigan, in September 2020, about a month before their arrest. Roth played a conversation of Croft talking about militias overthrowing governments in various states and “breaking a few eggs” if necessary. “When this man talks to you at a diner about killing people, you don’t stand up and walk out, do you sir?” Roth asked. “You don’t say, ‘This group is not for me,’ do you sir?” “No,” Harris answered. A “shoot house” that was intended to resemble Whitmer's second home was a key part of the Luther training weekend, according to the government. Harris admitted that he brought materials but said he didn’t build it with her house in mind. He didn't participate in an evening ride to Elk Rapids, Michigan, to scout Whitmer’s home and a bridge during that same weekend. Harris said he had purchased $200 of cheap beer and cigarettes so he could return to the camp and “get wasted” with others. Two more men, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, pleaded guilty and cooperated with investigators. Garbin last week said the group acted willingly and hoped to strike before the election, cause national chaos and prevent Joe Biden from winning the presidency. Whitmer, a Democrat, rarely talks publicly about the kidnapping plot, though she referred to “surprises” during her term that seemed like “something out of fiction” when she filed for reelection on March 17. She has blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case. Whitmer has said Trump was complicit in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. ——— Find AP’s full coverage of the Whitmer kidnap plot trial at: https://apnews.com/hub/whitmer-kidnap-plot-trial ——— White reported from Detroit.",6
"The war is a ""tactical disaster"" for Russia, retired Gen. Robert Abrams said. Key lessons from the Ukraine conflict about conventional warfare More than a month into Russia's invasion, the Ukrainian military has fared better than many expected given its smaller size, budget and number of munitions compared to its adversary. This week, Ukrainian forces reclaimed a town in the northeastern part of the country, while Russian ground forces have stalled around the capital, with some troops moving away from Kyiv and nearby Chernihiv, U.S. officials said. Intelligence experts had initially anticipated that Russia would take Kyiv within days of its attack on Ukraine. ""They failed to take Kyiv, which we believe was a key objective,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters this week. ""Not only do they not manage to take Kyiv, they've not managed to take any population centers and the Ukrainians have been fighting back very hard."" Among the factors shaping the ""David and Goliath"" conflict up to this point has been Ukraine's ""smart tactical use"" of its anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, alongside poor planning on the part of Russia, according to retired Gen. Robert Abrams, an ABC News contributor and the former commander of U.S. forces in Korea. ""'They [Russia] have numerical superiority, that's a fact. … They have an enormous missile inventory compared to Ukrainians,"" he said. ""That being said, what we overestimated though, is their ... warfighting competence."" Within days of its invasion, Russia was struggling with fuel and logistics supplies, and verified images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks circulated online. In its latest casualty numbers, Russia’s general staff said late last week that 1,351 Russian soldiers have been killed so far, though NATO last week estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 had died. The West has worked quickly to send weaponry to Ukraine since the start of the invasion. The U.S. and NATO supplied Ukraine with more than 17,000 anti-tank weapons, including Javelin missiles, in less than a week, the New York Times reported in early March. The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military aid into Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons such as the Javelin and Stinger systems, which can be fired by just one or two people. Other countries, including Germany and the U.K., have provided similar weapons. The shoulder-mounted Javelin in particular has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Known as a ""fire and forget"" weapon, the Javelin uses an infrared guidance system to travel toward a target, allowing the gunner to fire and then immediately take cover. The missile system can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. The shoulder-fired Stinger missiles target low-flying aircraft. During a Congressional hearing Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, praised Ukraine’s military and their ability to stall Russian military operations throughout the country, especially through the weapons systems being provided by the U.S. military. ""The Ukrainian armed forces show a very, very positive learning curve, and so I'm optimistic about being able to force additional stalling on behalf of the Russians,"" he said. The Javelin and Stinger, which have been used by the U.S. military for over 30 years, are ""very, very effective at what they're intended to do,"" Abrams said. A lone defender could help keep the attacking enemy at bay up to 2 miles away, and aircraft about 6 miles away, he said, showing the power of their range and precision. With enough weapons, ""a defender can keep a much larger enemy force that's mounted in their armored vehicles and trucks, and can keep them at bay because they can't ever get close enough to touch the defenders,"" he said. ""That's really what the advantage is of using these systems."" Anti-tank weapons aren't always a guarantee of success, Abrams said, noting that the attacking force could use a strategy known as combined arms maneuver to defeat them. That might look like firing artillery in advance of armored columns, using smoke -- an obscurant -- to prevent the Ukrainian gunners from seeing the Russian targets and integrating helicopters, he said. To Ukraine's advantage, the Russians are not utilizing this strategy, according to Abrams. ""Frankly, they've made it much, much easier for the Ukrainian defenders with these weapon systems that are getting so much notoriety,"" Abrams said. At the same time, the Ukrainians have carefully chosen where to use these weapons systems ""to maximum advantage"" on their home turf, he said. ""What we're seeing though is such poor tactics by the Russians, it has compounded the effects of the Ukrainian's use of these anti-tank weapons systems,"" Abrams said. The Ukrainians are ""putting up one heck of a fight,"" he added. ""They're utilizing excellent tactics where they are maximizing the effect of their weapons system with the terrain. … I don't want to minimize that. But the Russian army has been equally inept, and it's been a tactical disaster."" Russia's military said last week that it had generally accomplished the ""first stage of the operation"" and reduced the Ukrainian forces ""considerably,"" and would focus on its"" ""top goal"" -- liberating the Donbas region. Russia has claimed to have destroyed thousands of Ukraine's military vehicles, including tanks, and hundreds of aircraft during its so-called military operation. Amid pleas from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more weapons, one potential concern is supply. There is not an unlimited supply of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, Abrams said. ""I suspect as the defense industry cranks up production, that there's going to be some supply chain problems,"" he said. ""For Ukraine specifically, they're going to have a supply management challenge, whereby they're going to have to be very smart in how they distribute these key munitions."" Another ""decisive factor"" in Ukraine's war-fighting competence has been training, Abrams said. After Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, military aid from the West has included helping Ukrainian soldiers improve their tactical fighting. ""Russia clearly has the numbers, they have the technological advantage, but we're seeing the value of high-quality training, tough realistic training,"" combined with ""this very precise, exquisite capability for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons systems,"" Abrams said. ""They are achieving success and they have denied Russia and their initial objectives in this war."" Ukraine has also begun developing a noncommissioned officer corps -- considered the backbone of the military, who have extensive education and are empowered to lead soldiers, the retired general said. Russia, by contrast, has not made a commitment in noncommissioned officers, and instead is very centralized in who has the authority to give orders and has had several senior Russian army leaders reportedly killed in action, Abrams said. ""We're seeing the benefits of this training, in this professional development, as it plays out on the battlefield,"" Abrams said. ""We're seeing these small groups of Ukrainian soldiers seemingly outnumbered and outgunned achieving amazing success."" ""When you have the power of junior leaders and non-commissioned officers with the right equipment, and they have freedom of action to make decisions to seize the initiative when initiative appears, to take initiative and make those tough decisions without having to call someone -- that is often the difference between victory and defeat on the battlefield,"" he said.

"March marks the 11th consecutive month of job growth above 400,000.  Biden on jobs report: ‘Americans are back to work’ President Joe Biden touted the nation's economic recovery on Friday while also acknowledging the financial hardships currently intensified by the war in Ukraine. ""Americans are back to work,"" Biden said from the White House. ""Record job creation. Record unemployment decline. Record wage gains."" U.S. employers added 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. ""Even though we created a record number of jobs we know -- I know -- that this job is not finished. We need to do more to get prices under control. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world,"" Biden continued, noting his unprecedented order Thursday to release up to 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He placed blame on Putin's invasion of Ukraine for driving up gas and food prices worldwide in what the Biden White House has labeled as ""Putin's price hike."" ""Nations are coming together to deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American families, not only American families but families in Europe and around the world,"" Biden added. He did not take reporters' shouted questions on inflation following his prepared remarks, telling them that there will be ""plenty of time to answer questions"" next week. Though the March report came in slightly below economists' expectations, the numbers for January and February were revised higher to show 95,000 more jobs added in those months. The report also showed that notable job gains continued in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade and manufacturing. The labor force participation rate, or the number of people in the economy looking for work, is inching almost back to where it was before the pandemic. As employees head back to the office, teleworking fell to 10% from 13% the previous month. March marks the 11th consecutive month of job growth above 400,000. According to The Wall Street Journal, this is the strongest job growth in the U.S. since 1939. More than 19.9 million of the 22 million jobs lost at the peak of the pandemic have now been recovered, with economists expecting a full recovery by the summer. ""The March jobs report was right down the fairway – lots of jobs, lower unemployment, and higher labor force participation. The job market is rip-roaring. While not quite back to full-employment, the economy is close, and at the current pace of job growth will be there by summer,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote on Twitter. ""But it is somewhat disquieting in that the job market must cool off quickly, or inflation, our number one economic problem, will soon be a much bigger one."" The report, while strong, comes amid soaring gasoline prices and 40-year high inflation, which has cost Biden in the polls ahead of this year's midterm elections. Seventy percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of inflation, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve just two weeks ago raised short-term interest rates for the first time since 2018 and said it will raise them six more times this year in an attempt to offset inflation.

"Inflation in Europe has soared to another record On Location: April 1, 2022 LONDON -- Inflation in Europe soared to another record, according to new EU figures released Friday, in a fresh sign that rising energy prices fueled by Russia’s war in Ukraine are squeezing consumers and adding pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates. Consumer prices in the 19 countries that use the euro currency rose by an annual rate of 7.5% in March, according to the European Union statistics agency, Eurostat. The latest reading smashed the high set just last month, when it hit 5.9%. It's the fifth straight month that inflation in the eurozone has set a record, bringing it to the highest level since recordkeeping for the euro began in 1997. Rising consumer prices are a growing problem around the world, making it more difficult for people to afford everything from groceries to their utility bills. Spiking energy costs are the main factor driving inflation in Europe, with those prices surging 44.7% last month, up from 32% in February, Eurostat said. Oil and gas prices had already been rising because of increasing demand from economies recovering from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. They jumped higher after Russia, a major oil and gas producer, invaded Ukraine, on fears that sanctions and export restrictions could crimp supplies. It's also getting more expensive to eat in Europe. Food costs, including alcohol and tobacco, rose 5%, compared with 4.2% in the prior month. Mina Agib, who runs an Egyptian restaurant called Meya Meya in Berlin, said prices for frying oil and meat have shot up by 70% to 100% recently. “Who isn’t affected?” Agib replied, when asked whether he’s feeling the impact of rising prices. Two weeks ago, one of his suppliers said meat prices would increase by 70 euro cents (77 cents) per kilogram, Agib said. “They told us to expect another increase next week.” To avoid losing money, Agib has had to raise the price of some dishes. One customer, angry at having to pay half a euro more for a plate of sliced meat, dips and salad, posted a negative online review — the first since his restaurant opened over a year ago. “We’re between a rock and a hard place,” he said. “We want to keep customers happy with high-quality ingredients and homemade food. But we also have to pay the prices our suppliers demand.” At an outdoor market this week in Cologne, Germany, shopper Andreas Langheim also bemoaned how life was getting more expensive. “I can see the effect of increasing prices, especially here at the market,” Langheim, 62, said as he picked up some bread from a bakery van. “Everything is more expensive now.” Prices also increased for goods like clothing, appliances, cars, computers and books, up 3.4% from the 3.1% set the month before, and for services, which were up 2.7% from 2.5%. The latest figures make it more urgent for the European Central Bank to get off the sidelines and take action, analysts said. The bank is balancing record inflation with the threat that the war may hurt an economy under pressure. Last month, it sped up its exit from economic stimulus efforts to combat inflation, but has not taken more drastic steps. “We think that the ECB will soon conclude that it can’t wait any longer before starting to raise interest rates,” Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. Other central banks have started raising rates, including in the U.S., where inflation has soared to a 40-year high of 7.9%. European countries that don’t use the euro, including Britain, Norway and the Czech Republic have done the same. Italian Premier Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank president, outlined how the problem hits households. “Inflation is rising because raw materials prices are going up, in particular those for foodstuffs. Those are the ones that hit hardest a family’s buying power,’’ Draghi told foreign journalists Thursday. “Shortages in some raw materials creates a bottleneck in production and forces further price hikes.’’ Draghi said that as long as inflation remains temporary, governments can respond with budgetary measures, such as payments to help low-income families with higher heating and electricity costs. But if it becomes a longer-term issue, the response will have to be structural, he said. Italy’s construction industry has raised the alarm over how jobs at thousands of public and private construction sites are at risk from inflation. It warned that the sector could not only slow down but come to a complete halt because of soaring costs for fuel and raw materials, including iron, reinforced concrete and steel, which has doubled in price. ———— Associated Press journalists Frank Jordans in Berlin, Daniel Niemann in Cologne, Germany, Frances D’Emilio in Rome and Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.",6
"The men could face life in prison if convicted.  Jurors are hearing closing arguments against four of the six men who allegedly plotted to kidnap and kill Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. Federal prosecutors said Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft, Adam Fox and Daniel Harris trained extensively and were serious about carrying out their plot against Whitmer and her family. The four men on trial have pleaded not guilty. The other two men, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, have pleaded guilty to kidnapping charges. “You know what was in their minds when they thought nobody was listening, you know what was in their hearts,” U.S. attorney Nils Kessler told jurors in a Michigan court. “They said they wanted to kidnap the governor. They trained to kidnap the governor. They cased her house in the middle of the night. They knocked it out. They planned it. They gathered weapons and bombs ... they were going to be opportunistic and strike when the asset arises. That is the conspiracy that they're charged with. And in America it's a crime.” The alleged kidnapping would have taken place before the 2020 presidential election, the government said. The four men could face life in prison if found guilty. Prosecutors allege the men were predisposed to violent tendencies. “The evidence proves all of them were already willing to commit the crime,” Kessler said. Christopher Gibbons, the defense attorney for alleged ring leader, Adam Fox, said he was a “big talker” and Fox never had “any intention” of actually kidnapping Whitmer. Fox was also influenced by a government informant who took advantage of Fox’s poverty and history of substance abuse, according to Gibbons. “He talks about things the government doesn't like,” Gibbons said. “He talks about storming the Capitol. He talks about citizens arrest. He talks about a government that doesn't appreciate its citizens that takes advantage of its citizens from his perspective. He talks bad government talk. Talk, it's just talk. There’s no crime here.” After the alleged plot was thwarted, Whitmer told ""Good Morning America"" that the plan was larger than her. ""This was a very serious thought-out plot to kill police officers, to bomb our capitol, killing Democrats and Republicans alike, and to kidnap and ultimately put me on trial and kill me as well,"" Whitmer said. ""These are the types of things you hear from groups like ISIS. This is not a militia; it is a domestic terror organization.""",6
"The controversial policy was enacted during the Trump administration.  Biden administration to end border restrictions The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it is officially ending Title 42, the controversial policy implemented by the Trump administration restricting migrants from coming into the country under the auspices of a public health emergency. The policy was first enacted at the beginning of the pandemic and has remained in place since then, despite advocates criticizing the administration for keeping the policy in place. The lifting of Title 42 will occur on May 23 to give the Department of Homeland Security adequate time to prepare, including getting more COVID-19 vaccine doses and other measures to deal with the expected influx of migrants, the CDC termination notice written by Director Rochelle Walensky says. Earlier this week, the department gave reporters an estimate that up to 18,000 migrants could be apprehended at the border each day if Title 42 were to be lifted. “DHS has represented that over the next several weeks it is taking important steps to implement processes in preparation for the full resumption of border operations,” the order says. The termination notice says that Title 42 was implemented to prevent diseases from coming into the United States for only a period of time and DHS was consulted in the termination of this rule. “Following an assessment of the current epidemiologic status of the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. government’s ongoing response efforts, I find there is no longer a public health justification for the August order and previous orders issued under these authorities,” Walensky writes. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement that Title 42 is ""not an immigration authority, but rather a public health authority used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect against the spread of communicable disease."" “Once the Title 42 Order is no longer in place, DHS will process individuals encountered at the border pursuant to Title 8, which is the standard procedure we use to place individuals in removal proceedings,"" Mayorkas said. ""Nonetheless, we know that smugglers will spread misinformation to take advantage of vulnerable migrants. Let me be clear: those unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will be removed."" Homeland Security and State Department officials on a call with reporters Friday sought to reassure the American public that there is a plan in place to deal with the increase in migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border that lifting Title 42 will trigger. One of the driving reasons behind the delayed implementation of the Title 42 repeal is to allow authorities at the border time to ramp up the vaccination program announced last month, administration officials said Friday. “That is going to take some time to ramp up,” a senior DHS official said. “The time period is meant to ensure that we can do processing safely and humanely and consistent with best public health practices.” This week, CBP is distributing about 2,000 vaccines a day at 11 locations and plans to scale up the process in coming weeks to distribute 6,000 vaccines a day at more than two dozen locations along the border, one official said. Migrants will be given Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and those who refuse will either be detained or released with more stringent monitoring requirements, the official said. Officials said they are beefing up CBP and ICE officials at the border to deal with the expected influx of migrants. Border Patrol sources tell ABC News they are hiring as many agents as they can to help with potential processing increases. DHS officials told reporters the decision to terminate Title 42 was part of a “fact finding” mission about a “range of items” and trends on the southwest border. While the May 23 decision runs contrary to demands from advocates to immediately repeal the policy, agents at the border remain concerned that they will not have enough time to ramp up processing capacity in the event of the anticipated migration surge. FEMA is continuing to work with local nonprofits and municipal governments to fold them into the planning process for handling migrants as they're released. Officials told reporters they’ve been working with immigration groups to identify the particularly vulnerable individuals who are in Mexico and are looking for ways to “streamline the process.” ABC News' Mireya Villarreal contributed to this report.",2
"White House press secretary Jen Psaki isn't confirming reports that she'll soon take a TV job at MSNBC WASHINGTON -- White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday would not confirm reports that she will soon take a TV job at MSNBC, saying she is focused on her job speaking for President Joe Biden. “I have nothing to confirm about my length of public service or planned service or anything about consideration about next plans,” Psaki said under questioning at her first briefing after COVID-19 forced her into quarantine for a second time in late-March. “I'm very happy to be standing with all of you here today after it felt like a never-ending time in my basement quarantining away from my family,” she said. “My focus every day continues to be speaking on behalf of the president."" The Axios news site first reported Friday, citing a source close to the matter, that Psaki is in exclusive talks to join MSNBC after she leaves the White House around May. Multiple MSNBC representatives did not respond Friday to emailed requests for comment. Reports earlier this year said Psaki was being heavily courted by both MSNBC and CNN, where she provided on-air commentary before joining then-President-elect Biden's transition team. The Axios report Friday suggested that Psaki, 43, had narrowed her search. Under questioning Friday about her future employment and the ethics of negotiating a TV job while still serving as a public face for the administration, Psaki repeatedly stressed that she has complied with all ethical and legal requirements imposed by the Biden administration. “I have always gone over and above the stringent ethical and legal requirements of the Biden administration, and I take that very seriously,” she said. “And as is standard for every employee at the White House, I've received rigorous ethics counseling, including as it relates to any future employment.” White House press secretaries typically do not hold the grueling job for very long, and presidents often are served by multiple chief spokespersons. President Barack Obama had three during his eight years in office, while President Donald Trump had four during his four-year term. Psaki has been open about saying she would hold the job for at least a year before she started to think about moving on, often citing her young son and daughter as a reason. In May 2021, she spoke to political strategist and podcast host David Axelrod about why she loved the job of White House press secretary — and why she was unlikely to still be doing it a year later. “I have little kids and I don’t want to miss time with them. I don’t want to miss moments,” she said. She expressed similar sentiment Friday. “At whatever time I leave the White House, I can promise you the first thing I’m going to do is sleep and spend time with my 3- and 6-year-olds, who are my most important audiences of all,” Psaki said. —- Associated Press Radio Correspondent Sagar Meghani and AP News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.",7
"German prosecutors say they have charged a former German military reserve officer with spying for a Russian intelligence service for several years President Biden speaks out on Vladimir Putin amid possible Kremlin turmoil BERLIN -- German prosecutors say they have charged a former German military reserve officer with spying for a Russian intelligence service for several years. Federal prosecutors said Friday that the indictment against the suspect, identified only as Ralph G. in line with German privacy rules, was filed March 16 at the state court in Duesseldorf. They said that, in addition to his position in the German military, the suspect was a member of several German business committees thanks to his civilian job. They didn't elaborate. The suspect allegedly was in contact with Russian intelligence “via various people” by October 2014 and passed on information connected to his military and business activities until March 2020. Prosecutors said that included information on the German Bundeswehr's reserves and on civilian-military cooperation, as well as insights on the effect of sanctions imposed against Russia in 2014 on Germany, the European Union, and on the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project. The suspect also allegedly provided his handlers with private contact details for high-ranking military and business officials. He also provided an “overview” of the security and defense policy of the U.S. and its Western allies, according to prosecutors. In return for his efforts, he received invitations to Russian official events, they said.",0
"The lawmakers investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol are increasingly going public with critical statements, court filings and more to deliver a blunt message to Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice: Capitol riot investigation latest WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol are increasingly going public with critical statements, court filings and more to deliver a blunt message to Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice. President Donald Trump and his allies likely committed crimes, they say. And it’s up to you to do something about it. “Attorney General Garland, do your job so we can do ours,” prodded Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia. “We are upholding our responsibility. The Department of Justice must do the same,” echoed Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Their rhetoric, focused this week on two contempt of Congress referrals approved by the committee, is just the latest example of the pressure campaign the lawmakers are waging. It reflects a stark reality: While they can investigate Jan. 6 and issue subpoenas to gather information, only the Justice Department can bring criminal charges. Committee members see the case they are building against Trump and his allies as a once-in-a-generation circumstance. If it's not fully prosecuted, they say, it could set a dangerous precedent that threatens the foundations of American democracy. The lawmakers seem nearly certain to send a criminal referral to the Justice Department once their work is through. It all puts Garland, who has spent his tenure trying to shield the Justice Department from political pressure, in a precarious spot. Any criminal charges related to Jan. 6 would trigger a firestorm, thrusting prosecutors back into the partisan crossfire that proved so damaging during the Trump-Russia influence investigation and an email probe of Hillary Clinton. Garland has given no public indication about whether prosecutors might be considering a case against the former president. He has, though, vowed to hold accountable “all January 6th perpetrators, at any level” and has said that would include those who were “present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.” It's already the largest criminal prosecution in the department's history — for rioters who entered the Capitol building on Jan. 6 as well as members of extremist groups who are accused of planning the attack. More than 750 people have been charged with federal crimes. Over 220 riot defendants have pleaded guilty, more than 100 have been sentenced and at least 90 others have trial dates. Parts of the department's investigation have overlapped with the committee's. One example is in late January when Justice announced it had opened a probe into a fake slate of electors who falsely tried to declare Trump the winner of the 2020 election in seven swing states that Joe Biden won. Three days later, lawmakers subpoenaed more than a dozen people involved in the effort. But the Jan. 6 committee wants more. Their message was amplified this week when a federal judge in California — District Judge David Carter, a Bill Clinton appointee — wrote that it is “more likely than not” that Trump himself committed crimes in his attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election. The practical effect of that ruling was to order the release of more than 100 emails from Trump adviser John Eastman to the Jan. 6 Committee. But lawmakers zeroed in on a particular passage in the judge’s opinion that characterized Jan. 6 as a “coup.” “Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history. Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower—it was a coup in search of a legal theory,” Carter wrote. But experts caution that Carter's opinion was only in a civil case and does not meet the longstanding charging policy the Justice Department is required to meet. Justin Danilewitz, a Philadelphia-based attorney and former federal prosecutor, noted the department faces a higher burden of proof in court to show that presidential immunity should not apply. And he said the legal advice Trump received from Eastman “undermines an inference of corrupt or deceitful intent."" The department will be guided by the evidence and law, he said, ""but the social and political ramifications of a decision of this kind will not be far from the minds of Attorney General Garland and his staff.” “A decision to bring or not bring criminal charges will have significant ripple effects,"" he added. Taylor Budowich, a Trump spokesperson, called the judge’s ruling an “absurd and baseless ruling by a Clinton-appointed Judge in California.” He called the House committee’s investigation a “circus of partisanship.” Another point of friction with the Justice Department is the effort to enforce subpoenas through contempt of Congress charges. The House approved a contempt referral against former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in December after he ceased cooperating with the Jan. 6 panel. While an earlier contempt referral against former Trump adviser Steve Bannon resulted in an indictment, the Department of Justice has been slower to decide whether to prosecute Meadows. “The Department of Justice is entrusted with defending our Constitution,” Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican committee chair, said at a hearing this week. “Department leadership should not apply any doctrine of immunity that might block Congress from fully uncovering and addressing the causes of the January 6 attack.” A decision to pursue the contempt charges against Meadows would have to come from career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington before senior Justice Department officials would weigh in and decide how to proceed. Bringing a case against Meadows would be more challenging for prosecutors than the case against Bannon, in large part because Bannon wasn’t a White House official during the insurrection. The Justice Department has long maintained that senior aides generally cannot be forced to testify if a president invokes executive privilege, as Trump has done. And bringing charges could risk undermining the longstanding principle that lets the executive branch of the government keep most discussions private. While the majority of committee members have turned up the pressure on Garland, one member, Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, has not gone as far. “I feel strongly that we restore the tradition of respect for the independence of the law enforcement function,” Raskin told reporters this week. “That was one of the things that got trashed during the Trump period. And so I think that Congress and the president should let the Department of Justice and attorney general do their job.” “Attorney General Garland is my constituent,” Raskin added, “and I don’t beat up on my constituents.”",3
"The move is intended to cut emissions and make vehicles more efficient.  Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg on the nation's high fuel prices New cars in the U.S. will need to meet stricter fuel economy standards, the Biden administration announced Friday. The rule will require passenger cars, trucks and vans produced for the model year 2026 to average 49 miles per gallon, the Department of Transportation said. It will also increase fuel efficiency 8% annually for model years 2024-2025 and 10% annually for the model year 2026. ""Starting in model two-year 2024, when these standards take effect, Americans buying a new vehicle will spend less on gas than they would have if we hadn't taken this step,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a press conference at the agency's headquarters Friday. The administration says the new requirements will reduce fuel use by more than 200 billion gallons through 2050, and estimates it will prevent 5.5 trillion pounds of carbon dioxide from going into the atmosphere between now and 2050. ""These vehicles will be better for the environment, safer than ever, and cost less to fuel over their lifetimes,"" added Dr. Steven Cliff, the deputy administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The move comes amid high gas prices across the country. President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he was ordering the release of roughly 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve over the next six months to reduce energy and gas prices. Ford Motor Company applauded the announcement in a statement saying it's ""an important step toward achieving our shared national goals.""",6
"“This is unacceptable. There’s no evidence to this,” Kevin McCarthy said. Congressman under fire for stunning claims made on podcast Republicans on Capitol Hill appeared frustrated with the weeklong controversy sparked by Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who made unsubstantiated claims in a recent interview that some of his colleagues invited him to sex parties and used cocaine. ""It's pretty clear to me that Madison must have a far more active social life than any other member of Congress that I'm aware of,"" Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said Friday on Capitol Hill. ""What he's saying can't possibly be true."" The 26-year-old freshman Republican lawmaker from North Carolina was asked by a podcast host if his experience in Washington comported with the dark drama depicted in Netflix's ""House of Cards,"" the story of an ambitious lawmaker's murderous and cutthroat climb to the presidency. ""I look at all these people, a lot of them that I've always looked up to through my life, always paid attention to politics, guys that, you know -- then all of the sudden you get invited to, like, 'Oh hey, we're going to have kind of a sexual get-together at one of our homes. You should come.' And I'm like, 'What? What did you just ask me to come to?' And then you realize they're asking you to come to an orgy,"" Cawthorn said during a podcast interview with the ""Warrior Poet Society."" Cawthorn continued on the podcast: ""Or the fact that, you know, there's some of the people that are leading on the movement to try and remove addiction in our country, and then you watch them do a key bump of cocaine right in front of you. And it's like, this is wild."" Cawthorn's Republican colleagues have been quick to distance themselves from his comments and have denounced the allegations. At least one lawmaker, Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, expressed his frustrations about Cawthorn's comments during a closed-door GOP conference meeting on Tuesday. Womack told his colleagues that he has been forced to face questions about ""orgies"" and ""drug parties"" from his constituents, per sources familiar with his comments. Late Friday, Cawthorn released a statement blasting ""the left and the media"" for ""falsely"" insinuating his remarks about sex parties and cocaine were about members of Congress. ""My comments on a recent podcast appearance calling out corruption have been used by the left and the media to disparage my Republican colleagues and falsely insinuate their involvement in illicit activities,"" Cawthorn tweeted. Cawthorn added that he spent ""several days"" considering how to ""best address this controversy."" His statement comes two days after he was called in for a meeting with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republican leaders. During this meeting, Cawthorn himself told Republican leadership that a member of Congress had invited him to a sex party, but when pressed for more details, he refused to identify the lawmaker and ""backpedaled"" his claims, per a source familiar with the discussion. The meeting, which lasted 30 minutes, was attended by Cawthorn, McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise and GOP Rep. Mike Johnson, who had been assigned to mentor the freshman lawmaker last year. Politico first reported details of the meeting. McCarthy told reporters following the meeting that Cawthorn ""did not tell the truth"" and that he had admitted to exaggerating his claims. McCarthy said he told Cawthorn to change his behavior, otherwise there would be consequences. ""This is unacceptable. There's no evidence to this,"" McCarthy said. ""That's not becoming of a congressman. He did not tell the truth."" ""In the interview, he claims he watched people do cocaine. Then when he comes in, he tells me, he says he thinks he saw maybe a staffer in a parking garage from 100 yards away and tells me that he doesn't know what cocaine is basically,"" McCarthy said. ""The Constitution gives you the age when you could serve in Congress. But when you're in Congress, you should respect the institution and you should focus on the work that you should do,"" McCarthy said. He said he told Cawthorn that he had to ""earn his trust"" back, or else he could lose his committee assignments or face other punishment. ""He's got a lot of members very upset,"" McCarthy said, adding, ""You can't make statements like that, as a member of Congress; it affects everybody else and the country as a whole."" During his remarks to reporters, McCarthy pointed to other transgressions the young lawmaker had committed in recent months, including driving with a suspended license, inviting a congressional candidate on the House floor without permission and then lying about it and referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a ""thug."" Cawthorn's office did not return multiple requests for comment to ABC News, nor has Cawthorn provided proof to back up his claims. Sources familiar with the meeting told ABC News that the Republican leaders asked Cawthorn to issue a public apology and clarify his remarks. Cawthorn has not publicly apologized, but he did send a letter to constituents and even issued a new campaign ad, in which he defiantly said, ""I will never bow to the mob."" ""There are many who despise the great work we're doing to represent western North Carolina, but I promise, I will stay focused on the work that still needs to be done in Washington for my beautiful district,"" Cawthorn said. Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, who appeared visibly frustrated with Cawthorn during an interview with ABC News on Friday, called the allegations ""irresponsible."" ""If you say something like that, you corroborate that with other people,"" Nehls said. ""Listen, we all make mistakes in our lives."" Rep. Don Bacon, a veteran GOP lawmaker from Nebraska, told ABC News that Cawthorn's recent comments have reflected poorly on Congress as an institution. ""Allegations like that, if they're not true, hurt the whole institution,"" Bacon said. ""I think the view of the conference is, if they're true, name names."" ""Congress has got a low favorable rating, we've got to do better than this,"" he said. Both of North Carolina's Republican senators -- Richard Burr and Thom Tillis -- said they won't back Cawthorn in his upcoming primary race. ""On any given day, he's an embarrassment,"" Burr told reporters. Democrats also pounced on the controversy. ""Not sure why Republicans are acting so shocked by Cawthorn's alleged revelations about their party,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted. ""One of their members is being investigated for sex trafficking a minor and they've been pretty OK w/ that. They issued more consequences to members who voted to impeach Trump."" It's been a dizzying week for Cawthorn, who is thought to have ambitions for higher office after unexpectedly winning a seat in Congress vacated by former GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who left to serve as former president Donald Trump's chief of staff at the White House. Cawthorn has embraced Trump since taking office -- saying he has called him up for advice in the last year. The former president is clearly still on his side. On Friday, Trump announced Cawthorn would be a guest at his rally in North Carolina next weekend.",6
"""I will fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct."" Oscars producer Will Packer says LAPD was ready to arrest Will Smith Will Smith resigned his membership from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, the actor announced Friday. Smith said in a statement he was ""heartbroken"" over the incident and ""betrayed the trust of the Academy."" ""The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home,"" he said. The move comes two days after the Academy's Board of Governors announced it is beginning disciplinary procedures against Smith over the incident. ""I have directly responded to the Academy's disciplinary hearing notice, and I will fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct,"" Smith said in a statement. ""My actions at the 94th Academy Awards presentation were shocking, painful, and inexcusable."" In resigning, Smith said he wants to ""put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film."" He added that he will accept further consequences from the board. ""Change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason,"" he said. David Rubin, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, said in a statement, ""We have received and accepted Mr. Will Smith's immediate resignation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. We will continue to move forward with our disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the Academy’s Standards of Conduct, in advance of our next scheduled board meeting on April 18."" Smith went onto the stage at the 94th Academy Awards Sunday night and slapped Rock after the comedian made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith's hair. Back in his seat, Smith then shouted ""Keep my wife's name out of your f------ mouth"" twice. Smith refused to leave following his confrontation with Rock, according to the academy, and would later in the evening go on to win best actor for his role in ""King Richard."" He apologized to the academy during his acceptance speech. ""I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern. I want to apologize to the academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees,"" he said. ""Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things."" Smith formally apologized to the academy on Instagram the following day, saying, ""I deeply regret that my behavior has stained what has been an otherwise gorgeous journey for all of us."" The academy has more than 10,000 members, most of whom are eligible to vote for Oscar nominees. Membership is by invitation of the board and is limited to ""those who have distinguished themselves in the motion picture industry,"" according to the academy. At its board meeting on April 18, the academy said it may take disciplinary action against Smith, which could include suspension, expulsion or other sanctions. In the days since the Oscars, many said they were still shaken by the incident. Comedian Wanda Sykes, one of the co-hosts, told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview to air April 7 that she was ""sickened"" by what went down on stage. ""For them to let him [Smith] stay in that room and enjoy the rest of the show and accept his award, I was like: 'How gross is this?'"" Sykes said. ""This is just the wrong message. You assault somebody, you get escorted out the building and that's it."" In an exclusive interview with ABC News' TJ Holmes on ""Good Morning America,"" Oscars 2022 producer Will Packer said the Los Angeles Police Department was ready to arrest Smith, but that Rock was ""dismissive"" of the options police presented, insisting he was ""fine.""

"They are old, young, local, foreign, often new to war KYIV, Ukraine -- They are old, young, local, foreign, often new to war. Thousands of people have volunteered to join Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces and resist Russia’s invasion. The Associated Press this week spent time with some of them. A 30-year-old actor, Sergiy Volosovets, now commands a unit of 11 men and oversees the military training of other volunteers at a base northeast of the capital, Kyiv, just a few kilometers from the front line. After their training, they might join the fight or guard checkpoints. “They never thought that they would have a gun in their hands,” Volosovets said. But “this desire just brought all of them here.” At the beginning of the war, he said, fighters were sent to the front line after just two days of hurried training. Now instruction is more thorough. “We need self-conscious people who know what they’re doing,” he said. Among the volunteer fighters is 24-year-old sound engineer Kostyantyn Kovalenko. “As a sound engineer, I listen to the sounds of war I can hear, I think, a bit differently,” he said. He is bothered by the sounds like anyone else, but studies them and tries to identify the weapons. “I only regret that I don’t have my recorder to record the sounds and use them for a patriotic track,” he said. A husband and wife, Anton Grom and Valya Gromovytsya, both in their late 30s, have joined the fighters, leaving their 11-year-old son with his grandmother. “I want to defend Kyiv and kick the Russians out,” Gromovytsya said. One foreigner who has joined the volunteer fighters is 21-year-old Jraven Gerber from Seattle. He first tried to enter Ukraine’s International Legion, but he said they kept saying “Tomorrow, tomorrow.” Impatient, he decided to look elsewhere for action and connected with the Territorial Defense Forces. “I believe it’s best to fight when you’re young,” he said. Among his fellow fighters are people younger than him, 18 or 19, and “if they’re fighting, why shouldn’t I?” Francisco Floro, a 30-year-old from Spain, works in security back home and, like Gerber, saw defending Ukraine as a just cause. “I believe that all the West has a responsibility toward Ukraine,” said Floro. “We have to participate in this and tell the world what’s happening here.” He found his way to the Territorial Defense Forces after speaking with the Ukrainian embassy back home. Despite the drama of war, Floro said the life he eventually wants is a pretty tranquil one. “I don’t aspire to more than that,” he said. Like many of the volunteer fighters, 29-year-old local entrepreneur Vadym Kovalyov never expected to go to war. “These people, my brothers, they are in the right place,” he said. “They made the right choice not to go abroad. They stayed with the people and on our land to defend it.” ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"Dozens of Black Democratic candidates are seeking office in heavily Republican states that former President Donald Trump won easily in 2020 PINE BLUFF, Ark. -- Chris Jones would seem to have an ideal biography to run for governor, a job that's wide open in Arkansas for the first time in eight years. He's both an ordained Baptist minister and a nuclear engineer who can talk about his faith as easily as scientific concepts. He's upbeat and personable, as evidenced by his announcement video that quickly went viral nationwide. There's a catch, though. Jones is a Democrat in a state that has gone from red to extremely red in recent years. Donald Trump carried it in 2020 with 62% of the vote. And he's Black, where Black people account for only 16.5% of the population and where no African American has ever won statewide office. What's more, if he wins his party's nomination he'll probably have to face a nationally known figure: Sarah Sanders, the former press secretary for Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee. She's already raised more than $13.6 million. Most experienced pols consider the race beyond a long shot, but it represents a change in thinking about how the Democratic Party can rebuild in heartland states where it has become almost extinct as white rural voters migrated en masse to the GOP. In years past, Democrats in the region usually tried to win over independent and moderate voters by running white establishment candidates. That approach produced little. Now they're hoping to mobilize voters who haven't been involved in the process, especially Black, Latino and younger people. “It's clear to me folks are ready,"" Jones said during an interview in his hometown of Pine Bluff, a predominantly Black city an hour south of Little Rock. “There's a moment where folks are saying of all the barriers and the ceilings to be broken, here's one we want to break."" This year dozens of Black Democrats are running for office in places that Trump won easily. Many are political newcomers who were motivated by the protests over police tactics following the killing of George Floyd, or advances by Black Democratic candidates in once solidly red states like Georgia. “The ball is moving down the field in terms of more progress being made,"" said Tolulope Kevin Olasanoye with the Collective PAC, which recruits and supports Black candidates. Jones is one of two Black candidates running for Arkansas governor in the May Democratic primary, which also includes an Asian American woman. Two Black Democrats are also running for the Senate seat held by Republican John Boozman. African Americans are among the leading Democratic challengers for several Republican-held Senate seats, such as Cheri Beasley in North Carolina and Val Demings in Florida. In Kentucky, Charles Booker is making an uphill bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rand Paul. Iowa's Deidre DeJear is the only Democrat challenging Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. Black voters and officeholders already hold considerable sway in the Democratic Party in blue states, but some say it's time for African American candidates to take the lead in attracting new voters elsewhere and elevating top social issues. In Oklahoma, where the party has a long losing streak, many Democrats hailed the decision by the state's popular education commissioner, lifelong Republican Joy Hofmeister, to switch parties and challenge GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt as a Democrat. Even though it probably improved the party's chances, many African American activists were aggravated that Hofmeister, who is white, drew support away from Black candidate Connie Johnson. Hofmeister “is not coming to any Black Lives Matter protests,"" said Joshua Harris-Till, a Black party organizer and candidate for a U.S. House seat. “We’re probably not going to see her veto legislation like some of these insane gun bills. We’re not going to see her championing the right of women to choose.” In Arkansas, Jones, who had never run for office, launched his bid for governor with a video highlighting his roots in the state and drew contrasts with Sanders' frequent broadsides against the “radical left,"" criticism of President Joe Biden and echoes of Trump. He dubbed his platform “PB&J,"" which he says stands for preschool, broadband and jobs. Sanders, he charged, is engaging in “the kind of politics that fans the flames of an angry mob willing to mow down police officers in order to attack school kids at Little Rock Central High,"" a reference to the 1957 desegregation crisis. Sanders' campaign didn't respond to a request for comment on Jones' remark, and has essentially ignored him and her other rivals for governor. Jones' announcement video featured him walking into a church and using his minister's stole to tell his family's story. Jones, the son of two preachers, attended Morehouse College on a scholarship from NASA and later went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before jumping into the governor's race, Jones headed the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub, a nonprofit that helps entrepreneurs. The notion that Jones' candidacy will boost Democrats is met with skepticism in Arkansas. The state's last Democratic governor, Mike Beebe, won all 75 counties in 2010, but the party's last nominee won less than a third of the vote. “Generally speaking, the team that starts talking about voter turnout and even more so voter registration is the team that’s already guaranteed a loss,"" said University of Arkansas political science professor Janine Parry. White people make up 73% of the state's voting age population, compared with about 64% nationally. Parry, however, noted that such races could help build a bench of candidates and expand the electorate as the state's demographics change. Jones faces a huge fundraising gap. Sanders has been shattering fundraising records while Jones reported less than $200,000 on hand in his latest filings. But he is campaigning actively, holding voter registration drives and even venturing into seemingly hostile territory like Harrison, a town in the Ozarks that has struggled with racism and white supremacy over the years. Win or lose, he insists the effort is worth it. “Anytime you can bring candidates who can lift up the voice of those who haven’t been part of the process before — whether it’s Black, Latinx, disabled, veterans, you name it — who have been locked of the process, it’s going to be helpful,” Jones said. ——————- Associated Press reporter Sean Murphy contributed to this report from Oklahoma City",6
"The Senate acquitted former President Donald Trump last year of inciting the Capitol insurrection WASHINGTON -- The Senate acquitted former President Donald Trump last year of inciting the Capitol insurrection. But neither Trump nor any of his top advisers have faced charges over the attack in a court of law, and it's uncertain if they ever will. But increasingly, lawmakers on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault are pressing Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Trump and his associates. They've been laying out possible crimes in at least one court filing and openly discussing others, all related to that day's violent attack by Trump supporters looking to disrupt Congress' formal certification of his reelection defeat. Here's a look at some of the suggested crimes floated by the House panel: CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES After floating possible crimes for several months, lawmakers on the panel put it on paper for the first time in a March court filing. The filing was in response to a lawsuit from John Eastman, a lawyer and law professor who was consulting with Trump while attempting to overturn the election and who tried to withhold documents from the committee. The committee argued that it has evidence supporting the idea that Trump, Eastman and other allies of the former president “entered into an agreement to defraud the United States.” The panel says Trump and his allies interfered with the election certification process, disseminated misinformation about election fraud and pressured state and federal officials to assist in that effort. OBSTRUCTION OF AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING Late last month, U.S. District Court Judge David Carter appeared somewhat swayed by the panel’s arguments. In ordering Eastman to turn over the materials, Carter wrote that the court “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” In the filing, the committee argued that Trump either attempted or succeeded at obstructing, influencing, or impeding the ceremonial process on Jan. 6 and “did so corruptly” by pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the results as he presided over the session. Pence declined to do so. “President Trump and members of his campaign knew he had not won enough legitimate state electoral votes to be declared the winner of the 2020 Presidential election during the January 6 Joint Session of Congress, but the President nevertheless sought to use the Vice President to manipulate the results in his favor,” the committee wrote. COMMON LAW FRAUD The committee has also floated a charge of “common law fraud,” or falsely representing facts with the knowledge that they are false. Trump embarked on a wide-scale campaign to convince the public and federal judges that the 2020 election was fraudulent and that he, not Biden, won the Electoral College tally. Election officials and courts across the country, along with Trump’s attorney general, rejected those claims. As an example of such fraud, the committee noted in the Eastman filing that a Justice Department official told Trump directly that a Facebook video posted by his campaign “purporting to show Georgia officials pulling suitcases of ballots from under a table” was false, yet the campaign continued to run it. Georgia officials also repeatedly denied the claim. “The president continued to rely on this allegation in his efforts to overturn the results of the election,” the committee said. DERELICTION OF DUTY Though they didn’t lay it out in the Eastman filing, leaders of the House panel suggested earlier this year that they believe Trump could also be liable for “dereliction of duty,” or inaction as his supporters violently broke the windows and doors of the U.S. Capitol. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the committee chairman, said in January that “the harm that I see is the president of the United States seeing the Capitol of the United States under siege by people he sent to the Capitol and did nothing during that time."" The committee’s vice chairwoman, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, noted that same month that the panel knows from “firsthand testimony” that Trump watched the attack happen on television. “We know that he did not walk the very few steps to the White House briefing room, get on camera immediately, and tell the people to stop and go home,” she said. Cheney said it was hard “imagine a more significant and more serious dereliction of duty“ than Trump’s failure to quell the insurrection. FINANCIAL CRIMES While the committee hasn’t floated specifics, it has created an internal task force to investigate financing for the massive rally on the National Mall the morning of Jan. 6 and any donors who might have backed transportation or other costs that could have helped foster the violence. Asked earlier this year on CNN if they have any evidence of financial fraud, Thompson said members of the committee “have some concerns, but we have not made those concerns public at this point.” “We do think it’s highly concerning on our part that people raised monies for one activity, and we can’t find the money being spent for that particular activity,” Thompson said. “So, we will continue to look at it. And the financing is one of those things that we will continue to look at very closely.” UNCERTAINTY AHEAD More than 775 rioters have been arrested for crimes related to the insurrection. Yet legal consequences have been elusive for Trump and the other top officials who told lies about election fraud and laid the groundwork for their actions. Congress has no authority to prosecute, but can send so-called criminal referrals to the Justice Department. Garland can then decide whether to act. Justice Department action would be far from guaranteed. And it’s uncertain whether any charges against the oft-investigated president would hold up in court. It could be difficult for prosecutors to craft a winning case against Trump. The president urged on his massive crowd of supporters that morning and returned to the White House and watched them break into the Capitol on television. The rioters beat police, sent lawmakers running and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.",2
"Experts say the call is legally and constitutionally dubious. On Location: April 1, 2022 While many mainstream Republicans look toward making waves in the midterm elections, some are still clinging to the past. After GOP Rep. Mo Brooks' recently confessed that former President Donald Trump repeatedly urged Brooks to ""rescind"" the results of the 2020 presidential campaign, some Republicans are exploring -- even publicly vowing – to ""decertify"" President Joe Biden's victory, a move with no legal or constitutional basis. In late March, Brooks told ABC News that Trump requested several times he ""remove"" Biden from office, under the fraudulent assertion that the 2020 election was somehow tampered with and illegally skewed in Biden's favor. Brooks, in his own telling of the interaction, said he refused Trump's requests, writing the move off as impossible. ""We didn't get into the details [of how it would happen] because it's legally impossible. And I explained that fairly promptly,"" Brooks told ABC News in a phone interview. Brooks, who is now running for Senate from Alabama, disclosed this conversation to ABC News after Trump yanked his endorsement, in part for not aligning with Trump's baseless assertions regarding election interference. Yet, in Georgia, Trump-endorsed Republican Secretary of State candidate Rep. Jody Hice is leaning into his ties with the former president, and was caught on camera earlier this week committing to decertifying Biden's win if elected after pursuing relevant legal investigations. ""That's why I'm in the race,"" Hice told Lauren Windsor, an activist journalist, who questioned the representative posing undercover as a supporter at the Columbia County GOP meeting. ""If we lose fair elections, we're in trouble. We have to get to the bottom of this, and we've got to fix it going forward."" Hice's challenge to incumbent Brad Raffensperger, one of many of the former president's public enemies, showcases a clash of interests seen in Georgia's tumultuous Senate primary and in GOP races around the country. Trump-backed candidates who pursue his baseless claims of election fraud and push stringent revisions to election laws regardless of feasibility are facing off with Republicans who push back against Trump's bidding and risk losing favor from their constituency, and, in turn, public office. Such tension exists within statehouses already. Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, has shot down conversations by members of his own caucus regarding the possibility of decertifying Biden's victory in Wisconsin. ""I still believe that the Constitution and my oath that I took as an elected official does not allow me to decertify any election whether I want to or not,"" Vos said in March. ""That's not going to happen."" Similar calls for action are cropping up in the Illinois secretary of state race, too, where conservative candidate and former police sergeant Michelle Turney, told the Chicago Sun Times that her first priority, if elected, would be to ""decertify the 2020 Election on day one of my term."" While the promise of rewriting electoral history may be appealing to some voters, it's near impossible to execute legally, as Raffensperger contended on ABC News Live in January. ""The state election board cannot overturn the will of the people and it cannot overturn the election and it just wants to make sure that every county runs their elections well and I support accountability,"" said Raffensperger. And legal experts agree. After the fact ""decertification"" is in no way feasible. ""Certification happens ahead of an inauguration. After inauguration, the only legal or constitutional way to remove a president is through impeachment. Period. The end,"" said ABC News legal analyst Sarah Isgur. Kate Shaw, ABC News Supreme Court analyst and Cardozo Law professor, said there's ""no mechanism"" in the Constitution that would allow Republicans to deliver on this promise. ""The Constitution contains no mechanism for decertifying an election. Article II and the 12th Amendment, together with the Electoral Count Act, set forth the steps for counting state electoral votes and naming the president,"" said Shaw. ""That happened in January 2021, and that bell cannot be unrung, whatever transpires in the states afterwards.""",3
"The Muslim holy month of Ramadan — when the faithful fast from dawn to dusk — has begun in much of the Middle East, where Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sent energy and food prices soaring CAIRO -- The Muslim holy month of Ramadan — when the faithful fast from dawn to dusk — began at sunrise Saturday in much of the Middle East, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent energy and food prices soaring. The conflict cast a pall over Ramadan, when large gatherings over meals and family celebrations are a tradition. Many in the Southeast Asian nation of Indonesia planned to start observing Sunday, and some Shiites in Lebanon, Iran and Iraq were also marking the start of Ramadan a day later. Muslims follow a lunar calendar and a moon-sighting methodology can lead to different countries declaring the start of Ramadan a day or two apart. Muslim-majority nations including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates had declared the month would begin Saturday morning. A Saudi statement Friday was broadcast on the kingdom’s state-run Saudi TV and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, congratulated Muslims on Ramadan's arrival. Jordan, a predominantly Sunni country, also said the first day of Ramadan would be on Sunday, in a break from following Saudi Arabia. The kingdom said the Islamic religious authority was unable to spot the crescent moon indicating the beginning of the month. Indonesia’s second-largest Islamic group, Muhammadiyah, which counts more than 60 million members, said that according to its astronomical calculations Ramadan begins Saturday. But the country's religious affairs minister had announced Friday that Ramadan would start on Sunday, after Islamic astronomers in the country failed to sight the new moon. It wasn't the first time the Muhammadiyah has offered a differing opinion on the matter, but most Indonesians — Muslims comprise nearly 90% of the country’s 270 million people — are expected to follow the government’s official date. Many had hoped for a more cheerful Ramadan after the coronavirus pandemic blocked the world’s 2 billion Muslims from many rituals the past two years. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, however, millions of people in the Middle East are now wondering where their next meals will come from. The skyrocketing prices are affecting people whose lives were already upended by conflict, displacement and poverty from Lebanon, Iraq and Syria to Sudan and Yemen. Ukraine and Russia account for a third of global wheat and barley exports, which Middle East countries rely on to feed millions of people who subsist on subsidized bread and bargain noodles. They are also top exporters of other grains and sunflower seed oil used for cooking. Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, has received most of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine in recent years. Its currency has now also taken a dive, adding to other pressures driving up prices. Shoppers in the capital Cairo turned out earlier this week to stock up on groceries and festive decorations, but many had to buy less than last year because of the soaring prices. Ramadan tradition calls for colorful lanterns and lights strung throughout Cairo's narrow alleys and around mosques. Some people with the means to do so set up tables on the streets to dish up free post-fast Iftar meals for the poor. The practice is known in the Islamic world as “Tables of the Compassionate.” “This could help in this situation,” said Rabei Hassan, the muezzin of a mosque in Giza as he bought vegetables and other food from a nearby market. “People are tired of the prices.” Worshippers attended mosque for hours of evening prayers, or “tarawih.” On Friday evening, thousands of people packed the al-Azhar mosque after attendance was banned for the past two years to stem the pandemic. “They were difficult (times) ... Ramadan without tarawih at the mosque is not Ramadan,” said Saeed Abdel-Rahman, a 64-year-old retired teacher as he entered al-Azhar for prayers. Soaring prices also exacerbated the woes of Lebanese already facing a major economic crisis. Over the past two years, the currency collapsed and the country’s middle class was plunged into poverty. The meltdown has also brought on severe shortages in electricity, fuel and medicine. In the Gaza Strip, few people were shopping Friday in markets usually packed at this time of year. Merchants said Russia’s war on Ukraine has sent prices skyrocketing, alongside the usual challenges, putting a damper on the festive atmosphere that Ramadan usually creates. The living conditions of the 2.3 million Palestinians in the impoverished coastal territory are tough, compounded by a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007. Toward the end of Ramadan last year, a deadly 11-day war between Gaza’s Hamas rulers and Israel cast a cloud over festivities, including the Eid al-Fitr holiday that follows the holy month. It was the fourth bruising war with Israel in just over a decade. In Iraq, the start of Ramadan highlighted widespread frustration over a meteoric rise in food prices, exacerbated in the past month by the war in Ukraine. Suhaila Assam, a 62-year-old retired teacher and women’s rights activist, said she and her retired husband are struggling to survive on their combined pension of $1,000 a month, with prices of cooking oil, flour and other essentials having more than doubled. “We, as Iraqis, use cooking oil and flour a lot. Almost in every meal. So how can a family of five members survive?” she asked. Akeel Sabah, 38, is a flour distributor in the Jamila wholesale market, which supplies all of Baghdad’s Rasafa district on the eastern side of the Tigris River with food. He said flour and almost all other foodstuffs are imported, which means distributors have to pay for them in dollars. A ton of flour used to cost $390. “Today I bought the ton for $625,” he said. “The currency devaluation a year ago already led to an increase in prices, but with the ongoing (Ukraine) crisis, prices are skyrocketing. Distributors lost millions,” he said. In Istanbul, Muslims held the first Ramadan prayers in 88 years in the Hagia Sophia, nearly two years after the iconic former cathedral was converted into a mosque. Worshippers filled the 6th-century building and the square outside Friday night for tarawih prayers led by Ali Erbas, the government head of religious affairs. Although converted for Islamic use and renamed the Grand Hagia Sophia Mosque in July 2020, COVID-19 restrictions had limited worship at the site. “After 88 years of separation, the Hagia Sophia Mosque has regained the tarawih prayer,” Erbas said, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. ——— Associated Press writers Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia; Andrew Wilks in Istanbul; and Abdulrahman Zeyad in Baghdad contributed to this report.",6
"Russia’s assault on Ukraine and its veiled threats of using nuclear arms have policymakers past and present thinking the unthinkable: How should the West respond to a Russian battlefield explosion of a nuclear bomb President Zelenskyy proclaims Kyiv region liberated from Russian forces WASHINGTON -- Russia’s assault on Ukraine and its veiled threats of using nuclear arms have policymakers, past and present, thinking the unthinkable: How should the West respond to a Russian battlefield explosion of a nuclear bomb? The default U.S. policy answer, say some architects of the post-Cold War nuclear order, is with discipline and restraint. That could entail stepping up sanctions and isolation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Rose Gottemoeller, deputy secretary-general of NATO from 2016 to 2019. But no one can count on calm minds to prevail in such a moment, and real life seldom goes to plan. World leaders would be angry, affronted, fearful. Miscommunication and confusion could be rife. Hackers could add to the chaos. Demands would be great for tough retaliation — the kind that can be done with nuclear-loaded missiles capable of moving faster than the speed of sound. When military and civilian officials and experts have war-gamed Russian-U.S. nuclear tensions in the past, the tabletop exercises sometimes end with nuclear missiles arcing across continents and oceans, striking the capitals of Europe and North America, killing millions within hours, said Olga Oliker, program director for Europe and Central Asia at the International Crisis Group. “And, you know, soon enough, you’ve just had a global thermonuclear war,” Oliker said. It’s a scenario officials hope to avoid, even if Russia targets Ukraine with a nuclear bomb. Gottemoeller, a chief U.S. nuclear negotiator with Russia for the Obama administration, said that the outlines that President Joe Biden has provided so far of his nuclear policy stick with those of past administrations in using atomic weapons only in “extreme circumstances.” “And a single Russian nuclear use demonstration strike, or -- as horrific as it would be -- a nuclear use in Ukraine, I do not think would rise to that level"" of demanding a U.S. nuclear response, said Gottemoeller, now a lecturer at Stanford University. For former Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who over nearly a quarter-century in Congress helped shape global nuclear policy, the option of Western nuclear use has to remain on the table. “That's what the doctrine of mutual assured destruction has been about for a long, long time,” said Nunn, now strategic adviser to the Nuclear Threat Initiative security organization, which he co-founded. “If President Putin were to use nuclear weapons, or any other country uses nuclear weapons first, not in response to a nuclear attack, not in response to an existential threat to their own country ... that leader should assume that they are putting the world in the high risk of a nuclear war, and nuclear exchange,” Nunn said. For U.S. officials and world leaders, discussions of how to respond to a limited nuclear attack are no longer theoretical. In the first hours and days of Russia's invasion, Putin referenced Russia's nuclear arsenal. He warned Western countries to stay out of the conflict, saying he was putting his nuclear forces on heightened alert. Any country that interfered with Russia's invasion would face consequences “such as you have never seen, in your entire history,” Putin declared. How to respond to any use by Russia of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons was among the issues discussed by Biden and other Western leaders when they met in Europe in late March. Three NATO members — the United States, Britain and France — have nuclear weapons. One overarching concern is that by casting some nuclear weapons as tactical weapons to be used in battle, Russia could break the nearly eight-decade global taboo against using a nuclear weapon against another country. Even comparatively small tactical nuclear weapons approach the strength of the atomic bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in World War II. Gottemoeller and Nunn praise Biden's restraint in the face of Putin's implicit nuclear warnings at the outset of the war. Biden made no known move to raise the U.S. nuclear alert status. The U.S. also postponed a routine Minuteman III test launch last month to avoid escalating tensions. But in the short term and long, the world appears more at risk of a nuclear conflict as a result of Putin's bungled invasion and nuclear threats, according to arms control experts and negotiators. The weaknesses that Russia's invasion exposed in its conventional military forces may leave Putin feeling even more compelled in the future to threaten nuclear use as his best weapon against the far-stronger United States and NATO. While Gottemoeller argued that Ukraine's surrendering of its Soviet nuclear arsenal in 1994 opened the door for three decades of international integration and growth, she said some governments may take a different lesson from nuclear Russia's invasion of non-nuclear Ukraine — that they need nuclear bombs as a matter of survival. Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute, said the nuclear danger is going up. “And we can tell which pathways would cause that risk to go up further. And certainly direct conflict with Russia from forces based in NATO countries is one pathway to a nuclear war,” Lewis said. Gottemoeller took heart in Putin grumbling publicly late last month about “cancel culture.” That suggested he was vulnerable to world condemnation over his Ukraine invasion, and worse to come if he broke the post-World War II taboo on nuclear attack, she said. Detonating a nuclear bomb in a country Putin sought dominion over, one next to his own, wouldn't be rational, Nunn said. But he said neither was Putin's announcement of heightened nuclear alert,. As a young congressional aide during the Cuban missile crisis, Nunn witnessed U.S. officers and pilots in Europe standing by for orders to launch nuclear weapons on the Soviet Union. The danger today isn't yet as great as in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles on Cuba raised the threat of nuclear war with the U.S., he said. But the risk of intentional nuclear escalation now is high enough to make a cease-fire in Ukraine crucial, Nunn said. The modern threat of cyberattacks adds to the risk of a mistaken launch. And it's not clear how vulnerable U.S. and, especially, Russian systems are to such hacking attempts, he said. Putin ""has been very reckless in his saber rattling with nuclear weapons,” Nunn said. “And that I think has made everything more dangerous, including a blunder.”",7
"In a public ceremony delayed two years by the pandemic, President Joe Biden on Saturday commissioned the USS Delaware, a nuclear attack submarine at the dock in Wilmington, Delaware WILMINGTON, Del. -- In a public ceremony delayed two years by the pandemic, President Joe Biden on Saturday commissioned the USS Delaware, a nuclear attack submarine, saying it would enhance national security, though he made no reference to the global turmoil from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""As the commander in chief, I believe it is our sacred obligation as a nation to prepare and equip those troops that we send into harm’s way and to care for them and their families when they return home,’’ he told a crowd of invited guests and dignitaries assembled on a sunny but chilly spring day on a restricted part of the dock in Wilmington. This latest Navy ship to carry the Delaware name, the president said in brief remarks, “is part of a long tradition of serving our nation proudly and strengthening our nation’s security ... not just us, but our allies and partners around the world as well. In fact it’s already been doing that for some time.’’ In April 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the United States, the Delaware was commissioned while underwater, a first for a Navy vessel. Since then it has been in training. After the ceremony, the president took a private tour of the Delaware. He did not respond to questions from reporters about Ukraine. First lady Jill Biden is the submarine's sponsor, a role meant to bring a vessel luck. During her remarks, she exclaimed: “Officers and crew of the USS Delaware, man our ship and bring her to life.” The crew responded, “Aye aye, ma’am” and, as she applauded, sailors in dress uniforms ran behind the crowd, then down onto the submarine and lined up on the deck. Saturday's commissioning comes amid the war in Ukraine and after Biden announced a budget blueprint that proposes spending $795 billion on defense, which would mean an increase for the Pentagon. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the proposal would at best “leave our armed forces simply treading water” because of inflation. But some progressive Democrats complained that was too much funding after the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan last summer. With a crew of 136 sailors, the Delaware is the 18th Virginia-class fast attack submarine, which is designed to seek and destroy enemy submarines and surface ships, and can fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, the Navy says. The ship is 377 feet long, can dive to depths greater than 800 feet and operate at speeds in excess of 25 knots submerged. The submarine is also designed to operate for more than three decades without needing to refuel, according to a Defense Department news release. This is the first time in a century the name “Delaware” has been used for a Navy vessel, according to a Defense Department statement, and marks the seventh naval ship named after the state which Biden represented in the Senate for 36 years before his tenures as vice president and president.",9
"The former chief prosecutor of U.N. war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia has called for an international arrest warrant to be issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin GENEVA -- The former chief prosecutor of United Nations war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda has called for an international arrest warrant to be issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Putin is a war criminal,” Carla Del Ponte told the Swiss newspaper Le Temps in an interview published Saturday. In interviews given to Swiss media to mark the release of her latest book, the Swiss lawyer who oversaw U.N. investigations in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia said there were clear war crimes being committed in Ukraine. She said she was particularly shocked by the use of mass graves in Russia's war on Ukraine, which recalls the worst of the wars in the former Yugoslavia. “I hoped never to see mass graves again,” she told the newspaper Blick. “These dead people have loved ones who don’t even know what’s become of them. That is unacceptable.” Other war crimes she identified in Ukraine included attacks on civilians, the destruction of civilian buildings and even the demolishing of entire villages. She said the investigation in Ukraine would be easier than that in Yugoslavia because the country itself had requested an international probe. The current ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, visited Ukraine last month. If the ICC finds proof of war crimes, she said, “you must go up the chain of command until you reach those who took the decisions.” She said it would be possible to bring even Putin to account. “You mustn’t let go, continue to investigation. When the investigation into Slobodan Milosevic began, he was still president of Serbia. Who would have thought then that he would one day be judged? Nobody,” she told Blick. Del Ponte added that investigations should be carried out into possible war crimes committed by both sides, pointing also to reports about the alleged torture of some Russian prisoners of war by Ukrainian forces. ——— This story corrects Del Ponte's title to chief prosecutor of U.N. war crimes tribunals. ——— Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-war.",6
"Bodies with bound hands, close-range gunshot wounds and signs of torture lay scattered in a city on the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian soldiers withdrew from the area BUCHA, Ukraine -- Bodies with bound hands, close-range gunshot wounds and signs of torture lay scattered in a city on the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian soldiers withdrew from the area. Ukrainian authorities accused the departing forces on Sunday of committing war crimes and leaving behind a “scene from a horror movie.” As images of the bodies emerged from Bucha, European leaders condemned the atrocities and called for tougher sanctions against Moscow. In a sign of how the horrific reports shook many leaders, Germany's defense minister even suggested that the European Union consider banning Russian gas imports. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital. One group of nine, all in civilian clothes, were scattered around a site that residents said Russian troops used as a base. They appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs, one was shot in the head, and another's legs were bound. Ukrainian officials laid the blame for the killings squarely at the feet of Russian troops, with the president calling them evidence of genocide. But Russia’s Defense Ministry rejected the accusations as “provocation.” The discoveries followed the Russian retreat from the area after Moscow said it was focusing its offensive on the country’s east. Russian troops had rolled into Bucha in the early days of the invasion and stayed up until March 30. One resident, who refused to give his name out of fear for his safety, said that Russian troops went building to building and took people out of the basements where they were hiding, checking their phones for any evidence of anti-Russian activity before taking them away or shooting them. Hanna Herega, another resident, said Russian troops started shooting at a neighbor who had gone out to gather wood for heating. “They hit him a bit above the heel, crushing the bone, and he fell down,” Herega said. “Then they shot off his left leg completely, with the boot. Then they shot him all over.” The AP also saw two bodies, that of a man and a woman, wrapped in plastic that residents said they had covered and placed in a shaft until a proper funeral could be arranged. “He put his hands up, and they shot him,” said the resident who refused to be identified. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, described bodies lying in suburban streets as a “scene from a horror movie.” He claimed some of the women had been raped before being killed and the Russians then burned the bodies. In a video address, Zelenskyy said Russian soldiers who killed and tortured civilians were responsible for “concentrated evil."" “It is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,” he said in remarks translated by his office. He directed some of his remarks at the mothers of Russian soldiers involved. “Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers?” he said. “You couldn’t overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure.” Zelenskyy said his government would take steps to create a special justice mechanism to investigate every crime committed by the Russian forces in Ukraine. Zelenskyy also appeared in a pre-recorded video message at Sunday's Grammy Awards, contrasting the lives of those attending the award ceremony in Las Vegas with the lives of musicians in his battered homeland. “Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them,” he said in English. “But the music will break through anyway.” Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that photos and videos of dead bodies “have been stage managed by the Kyiv regime for the Western media.” The ministry said “not a single civilian"" in Bucha had faced any violent military action and the mayor did not mention any abuses a day after Russian troops left. Russia asked for a meeting Monday of the U.N. Security Council to discuss events in the city. The U.S. and Britain have recently accused Russia of using Security Council meetings to spread disinformation. In Motyzhyn, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Kyiv, residents told AP that Russian troops killed the town’s mayor, her husband and her son and threw their bodies into a pit in a pine forest behind houses where Russian forces had slept. Inside the pit, AP journalists saw four bodies of people who appeared to have been shot at close range. The mayor’s husband had his hands behind his back, with a piece of rope nearby, and a piece of plastic wrapped around his eyes like a blindfold. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed that the mayor was killed while being held by Russian forces. Some European leaders said the killings in the Kyiv area amounted to war crimes. The U.S. has previously said that it believes Russia has committed war crimes, and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called images of what happened near Kyiv “a punch to the gut” on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “It is a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on the same show. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko called on nations to immediately end Russian gas imports, saying they were funding the killings. In a turnaround, Germany’s defense minister said that the EU should consider doing just that. Ministers “would have to talk about halting gas supplies from Russia,” Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said on German public broadcaster ARD. “Such crimes must not go unanswered.” Russia provides 40% of Europe’s gas and 25% of its oil, and until now many EU nations have resisted calls to scale back or fully end reliance on Russian fossil fuels. Giving them up would mean even higher prices at the pump and higher utility bills, potentially creating an energy crisis and a recession. The U.S. has previously announced a ban on Russian oil, but it imports only a small share of Russia’s oil exports and doesn’t buy any of its natural gas. As Russian forces retreated from the area around the capital, they also withdrew from the Sumy region, in Ukraine’s northeast, local administrator Dmitry Zhivitsky said in a video message carried by Ukrainian news agencies. The troops had occupied the area for nearly a month. They pressed their sieges in other parts of the country. Russia has said it is directing troops to the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years. In that region, Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov that has seen some of the war's greatest suffering, remained cut off. About 100,000 civilians — less than a quarter of the prewar population of 430,000 — are believed to be trapped there with little or no food, water, fuel and medicine. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday that a team sent Saturday to help evacuate residents had yet to reach the city. Ukrainian authorities said Russia agreed days ago to allow safe passage from the city, but similar agreements have broken down repeatedly under continued shelling. The mayor of Chernihiv, which has also been cut off from shipments of food and other supplies for weeks, said that relentless Russian shelling has destroyed 70% of the northern city. The Ukrainian military said early Monday that its forces had retaken some towns in the Chernihiv region and that humanitarian aid was being delivered. The road between Chernihiv and the capital, Kyiv, was to reopen to some traffic later in the morning, according to the news agency RBK Ukraina. The regional governor in Kharkiv said that Russian artillery and tanks launched over 20 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city and its outskirts in the country's northeast over the past day. The head of Ukraine’s delegation in talks with Russia said Moscow’s negotiators informally agreed to most of a draft proposal discussed during face-to-face talks in Istanbul this week, but no written confirmation has been provided. The Russian invasion has left left thousands dead and forced more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee their country. ——— Qena reported from Motyzhyn, Ukraine.

"Secret intelligence is playing an unusually public role in the war in Ukraine LONDON -- The war in Ukraine is the conflict where spies came in from the cold and took center stage. Since Russia invaded its neighbor in late February, intelligence agencies in the U.S. and Britain have been remarkably willing to go public with their secret intelligence assessments of what is happening on the battlefield — and inside the Kremlin. The U.S. this week declassified intelligence findings claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed about his military’s poor performance in Ukraine by advisers scared to tell him the truth. On Thursday a British spy chief said demoralized Russian troops were refusing to carry out orders and sabotaging their own equipment. Jeremy Fleming, who heads Britain’s electronic intelligence agency GCHQ, made the comments in a public speech where he said the “pace and scale” at which secret intelligence is being released “really is unprecedented.” Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at University College London, agreed that the very public intelligence campaign “reflects the fact that we now live in a different age, politically and internationally. And this is a different kind of war.” Officials say the stream of declassified intelligence — which includes regular briefings to journalists in Washington and London and daily Twitter updates from Britain’s defense ministry — has several aims. Partly it’s to let Putin know he is being watched, and to make him question what he’s being told. It’s also designed to embolden the Russian military to tell Putin the truth, and to convey to the Russian public that they have been lied to about the war. The U.S. and Britain also have released intelligence assessments in a bid to deter Russian actions. That was the case with recent warnings Russia might be preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. It’s all part of a closely coordinated trans-Atlantic strategy that has been in the works for months. Biden administration officials say they decided to aggressively share intelligence and coordinate messaging with key allies, including Britain, as U.S. concerns about Russian troop movements in autumn 2021 put the intelligence community on high alert. In early November, President Joe Biden dispatched CIA director William Burns to Moscow to warn that the U.S. was fully aware of Russian troop movements. The White House has typically been tight-lipped about the director’s travels, but the Biden administration calculated that in this situation they needed to advertise the visit far and wide. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow announced that Burns had met with top Kremlin officials shortly after his trip was over. Soon after Burns’ Moscow mission, U.S. officials decided they needed to accelerate intelligence sharing. Officials shared sensitive intelligence with other members of the Five Eyes alliance — Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand — and also with Ukraine. Director of national intelligence Avril Haines was dispatched to Brussels to brief NATO members on intelligence underlying growing American concerns that Russia seemed intent on invasion, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue. Some allies and analysts were skeptical, with memories lingering of past intelligence failings, like the false claim Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that was used to justify the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Late last year, France and Germany led a group of European countries that appeared to be seeing similar military intelligence as the U.S. and Britain, but were less convinced that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent. At NATO, Germany initially blocked the use of a system for helping Ukraine to acquire certain military equipment. France and Germany also blocked NATO from launching an early crisis planning system in response to the buildup, before relenting in December. This week, French media reported that the head of France’s military intelligence agency, which failed to anticipate the Russian invasion, has been removed from his post. Eric Vidaud’s departure comes amid soul-searching among France’s leadership about why it was taken by surprise by the war — which was particularly embarrassing for President Emmanuel Macron, who speaks regularly with Putin. Some see Vidaud as a scapegoat, and note that his removal comes just ahead of this month’s French presidential election. In January, as Russia amassed troops near Ukraine’s border, Britain’s Foreign Office issued a statement alleging that Putin wanted to install a pro-Moscow regime in Ukraine. The U.K. said it was making the intelligence assessment public because of the “exceptional circumstances.” Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24 largely silenced the doubters, and drew a unified response from NATO. The release of U.S. and British intelligence is partly designed to shore up that Western unity, officials and analysts say. Both Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson doubt Putin is serious about negotiating an end to the war and want to keep up the West’s military and moral support of Ukraine. The impact inside Russia is hard to measure. The U.S. official who spoke to the AP said the White House hopes divulging intelligence that Putin is misinformed could help prod the Russian leader to reconsider his options in Ukraine. But the publicity could also risk further isolating Putin or make him double down on his aim of restoring Russian prestige lost since the fall of the Soviet Union. The official said Biden is in part shaped by a belief that “Putin is going to do what Putin is going to do,” regardless of international efforts to deter him. Galeotti said Western intelligence agencies likely don’t know how much impact their efforts will have on Putin. “But there’s no harm in giving it a try,” he said. “Because when it comes down to it, in this kind of intensely personalistic system (of government), if one line, or one particular notion, happens to get through and lodge itself in Putin’s brain, then that’s a really powerful result.” ——— Madhani reported from Washington.

"Prime Minister Viktor Orban has declared victory in Sunday’s national elections, claiming a mandate for a fourth term as a still incomplete vote count gives a strong lead for his right-wing party BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban declared victory in Sunday's national elections, claiming a mandate for a fourth term as a still incomplete vote count showed a strong lead for his right-wing party. In a 10-minute speech to Fidesz party officials and supporters at an election night event in Budapest, Orban addressed a crowd cheering “Viktor!” and declared it was a “huge victory” for his party. “We won a victory so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels,” said Orban, who has often been condemned by the European Union for overseeing democratic backsliding and alleged corruption. While votes were still being tallied, it appeared clear that the question was not whether Orban’s Fidesz party would take the election, but by how much. With around 91% of votes tallied, Orban’s Fidesz-led coalition had won 53%, while a pro-European opposition coalition, United for Hungary, had just over 34%, according to the National Election Office. It appeared possible that Fidesz would win another constitutional majority, allowing it to continue making deep unilateral changes to the Central European nation. “The whole world has seen tonight in Budapest that Christian democratic politics, conservative civic politics and patriotic politics have won. We are telling Europe that this is not the past, this is the future,” Orban said. As Fidesz party officials gathered at an election night event on the Danube river in Budapest, state secretary Zoltan Kovacs pointed to the participation of so many parties in the election as a testament to the strength of Hungary’s democracy. “We have heard a lot of nonsense recently about whether there is democracy in Hungary,” Kovacs said. “Hungarian democracy in the last 12 years has not weakened, but been strengthened.” The contest had been expected to be the closest since Orban took power in 2010, thanks to Hungary’s six main opposition parties putting aside their ideological differences to form a united front against Fidesz. Voters were electing lawmakers to the country’s 199-seat parliament. Yet even in his home district, opposition leader Peter Marki-Zay trailed the longtime Fidesz incumbent Janos Lazar by more than 12 points, with more than 98% of the votes counted there. It was a discouraging sign for the prime ministerial candidate who had promised to end to what he alleges is rampant government corruption, raise living standards by increasing funding to Hungary’s ailing health care and schools and mend frayed relations with the country's Western partners. In a surprise performance, radical right-wing party Our Homeland Movement appeared to have garnered more than 6% of the vote, exceeding the 5% threshold needed to gain seats in parliament. Opposition parties and international observers have noted structural impediments to defeating Orban, highlighting pervasive pro-government bias in the public media, the domination of commercial news outlets by Orban allies and a heavily gerrymandered electoral map. Edit Zgut, a political scientist at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, predicted that a clear victory for Orban would allow him to move further in an autocratic direction, sidelining dissidents and capturing new areas of the economy. “Hungary seems to have reached a point of no return,” she said. “The key lesson is that the playing field is tilted so much that it became almost impossible to replace Fidesz in elections.” The opposition coalition, United For Hungary, asked voters to support a new political culture based on pluralistic governance and mended alliances with the country’s EU and NATO allies. Speaking to supporters in Budapest late Sunday, Marki-Zay conceded defeat but argued that Fidesz had won under a system of its own making. “We never thought this would be the result. We knew in advance that it would be an extremely unequal fight,"" Marki-Zay said. ""We do not dispute that Fidesz won this election. That this election was democratic and free is, of course, something we continue to dispute.” While Orban had earlier campaigned on divisive social and cultural issues, he dramatically shifted the tone of his campaign after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and has portrayed the election since then as a choice between peace and stability or war and chaos. While the opposition called for Hungary to support its embattled neighbor and act in lockstep with its EU and NATO partners, Orban, a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has insisted that Hungary remain neutral and maintain its close economic ties with Moscow, including continuing to import Russian gas and oil on favorable terms. At his final campaign rally Friday, Orban claimed that supplying Ukraine with weapons — something that Hungary, alone among Ukraine’s EU neighbors, has refused to do — would make the country a military target, and that sanctioning Russian energy imports would cripple Hungary's own economy. “This isn’t our war, we have to stay out of it,” Orban said. The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Saturday depicted the Hungarian leader as out of touch with the rest of Europe, which has united to condemn Putin, support sanctions against Russia and send aid including weapons to Ukraine. “He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr. Putin,” Zelenskyy said. While speaking to supporters on Sunday, Orban singled out Zelenskyy as part of the “overwhelming force” that he said his party had struggled against in the election — “the left at home, the international left all around, the Brussels bureaucrats, the Soros empire with all its money, the international mainstream media, and in the end, even the Ukrainian president.” Orban — a fierce critic of immigration, LGBTQ rights and “EU bureaucrats"" — has garnered the admiration of right-wing nationalists across Europe and North America. He has taken many of Hungary’s democratic institutions under his control and depicted himself as a defender of European Christendom against Muslim migrants, progressives and the “LGBTQ lobby.” Along with the election to parliament, a referendum on LGBTQ issues was being held Sunday. The questions pertained to sex education programs in schools and the availability to children of information about sex reassignment. The Organization For Security and Cooperation in Europe sent a full observation mission to Hungary to monitor Sunday’s election, only the second time it has done so in a European Union country. ——— Associated Press writer Vanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed to this report.",4
"Klain said Russia is looking to relaunch battles in eastern Ukraine. On Location: April 1, 2022 White House chief of staff Ron Klain is warning that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is “far from over,” despite the claim by Moscow that they are retreating from Kyiv and surrounding areas. “I think there's a lot of evidence that Putin is simply taking his troops out of the northern part of the country to redeploy them to the eastern part of the country to relaunch a battle there,” Klain said during an exclusive interview with ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. Klain said it’s “for Ukraine to decide” what a post-war country looks like when asked about the possibility that Russia overtakes eastern regions of Ukraine, while Ukraine maintains control of the rest. “I will tell you, as President Zelenskyy has said, that's not acceptable to him, and we are going to support him with military aid, with economic aid, with humanitarian aid,"" Klain said. ""The political future of Ukraine is up for Ukraine to decide.” As the United States continues to support Ukraine in the war, Klain also touted Biden's successes on the domestic front. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that 431,000 jobs were added to the economy in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%. Austan Goolsbee, Klain’s former colleague in the Obama administration, said the country may be moving toward the idea that the COVID-19 era of the U.S. economy is over with -- a sentiment Klain said he “cautiously” agrees with. “Right now, as we stand here today, our schools are open, our businesses are open, people are coming back to work, people are coming back into the labor force, we had a big jump in labor force participation in March,"" he said. ""So there’s a lot of encouraging signs, in terms of this economy, coming back to being a robust jobs and business creating economy.” Wages also rose last month, but they are not keeping up with rampant inflation, which is causing the cost of everything from food to gas to go up, and Americans are struggling to make ends meet. President Joe Biden is now at new lows in his overall approval rating -- 36% in a new Quinnipiac University poll -- and just one in three Americans approve of how he’s handling the economy. Republicans are poised to exploit that in the midterms, and Stephanopoulos pressed Klain on how Democrats should respond. “Gas prices are a problem, absolutely, George. That's why the president took the actions he took this week to release a million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to tell the oil companies they either need to pump oil on the 9,000 permits they have or give them back for others to do that, to increase production here,"" Klain responded. ""Those things we think are going to bring down the price of gasoline, relieve some of the pain at the pump. And we also have an agenda to cut taxes for people to bring down the cost of everyday things.” This is a developing story. Check back for updates.",3
"""I was hoping that I could be a part of that,"" the senator said. Sen. Roy Blunt says he will not support Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said he will not vote to support President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson for her historic confirmation to the nation's highest court, citing disagreements with her judicial philosophy. ""Initially, my sense is that the president certainly had every good intention and every right in the campaign to talk about putting the first Black woman on the court,"" Blunt told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos exclusively on Sunday. ""I think it's time for that to happen. I was hoping that I could be part of that."" He continued, ""I think she's certainly going to be confirmed. I think it'll be a high point for the country to see her go on the court. But I don't think she's the kind of judge that will really do the kind of work that I think needs to be done by the court. And I won't be supporting her, but I'll be joining others and understanding the importance of this moment."" The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Jackson's nomination Monday, but the full Senate has yet to schedule a vote. The federal judge is expected to be confirmed with at least one Republican vote, as Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced Wednesday that she would vote to confirm Jackson. Stephanopoulos pressed Blunt, asking, ""If it's a high point for the country, why not support her?"" ""Well, I think the lifetime appointments have different criteria than other appointments,"" Blunt responded, later adding that ""she just doesn't meet the criteria"" to secure his vote. Blunt met with Biden's nominee on March 16. He did not support her nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021. Stephanopoulos then turned to another issue facing the Supreme Court -- the controversy currently surrounding Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife's reported involvement in urging former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to attempt to overthrow the 2020 election results. ""How about these calls for Justice Thomas to recuse himself from the Jan. 6 investigation cases given the active involvement of his wife Ginni Thomas and the push for an ethics code for Supreme Court justices?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""The idea that you can't disagree with your wife on a public issue and still be able to function as a judge or as a government figure of any kind, I think is an idea that's long outlived any idea that it might be reasonable,"" Blunt answered. ""You know that he disagrees with her?"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""Judge Thomas has to decide that,"" Blunt said. ""In his personal opinions, I think in his writings over the years in -- aren't part of his judicial philosophy. He's going to look at the law. He's going to look at what the law says and what the Constitution says and rule in that regard."" He added that he is ""totally supportive"" of the Justice Department's investigation and prosecution of participants in ""any illegal activity"" during the Jan. 6 insurrection. Lawmakers on the House Jan. 6 Select Committee are pushing Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate former President Donald Trump and his associates. The pressure on the Justice Department follows a ruling from a federal judge in California last week who said it was ""more likely than not"" that Trump committed several federal crimes in an effort to overturn the 2020 election. When asked whether Trump should be subject to any federal prosecution, Blunt doubled down saying, ""I think the Justice Department has a job to do. They should do it. And people who were involved in planning or execution of illegal activities on Jan. 6 should be prosecuted."" Earlier on ""This Week,"" Stephanopoulos interviewed White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who defended the Biden administration's record as inflation and gas prices soar across the country. ""The biggest political issue in the country today is clearly inflation,"" Blunt said. ""All you have to do is go to the gas station or the grocery store or pay your winter heating bill to know that something unacceptable has happened."" Biden has ordered the release of 1 million barrels of oil each day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the course of the next six months, a plan he announced on Friday in an effort to lower gas prices nationwide following the ban on Russian oil imports. The Missouri Republican argued that oil prices were already at ""unacceptable levels long before [Vladimir] Putin did anything regarding Ukraine."" As Russian forces pull out of the capital city of Kyiv, Stephanopoulos asked, ""Do you believe that Russia is losing this war in Ukraine? And what more can the United States be doing right now to support the Ukrainian resistance?"" ""Well, I think we should be doing everything we can. We should give them what they need as quickly as they needed,"" Blunt answered, adding, ""What the president has done has generally been the right thing, but about two or three weeks slower than it should have been."" As a member who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Blunt emphasized the role of U.S. intelligence in assessing Russian military operations and debunking a possible false flag operation, which he called ""incredibly helpful."" He also echoed the widespread praise for the leadership of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding, ""I hope he continues to be safe and brave and his country is rallying behind that willingness to be there and be in the fight.""",7
"Shortages of some vital drugs have appeared in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and have persisted throughout the month of March First came the warnings, in messages among friends and families and on social media, to stock up on vital drugs in Russia before supplies were affected by crippling Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Then, some drugs indeed became harder to find at pharmacies in Moscow and other cities. “Not a single pharmacy in the city has it now,” a resident of Kazan told The Associated Press in late March about a blood thinner her father needs. Experts and health authorities in Russia say the drug shortages are temporary — due to panic- buying and logistical difficulties for suppliers from the sanctions — but some remain worried that high-quality medicines will keep disappearing in the Russian market. “Most likely there will be shortages. How catastrophic it will be, I don't know,” said Dr. Alexey Erlikh, head of the cardiac intensive care unit in Moscow Hospital No. 29, and a professor at the Moscow-based Pirogov Medical University. Reports that Russians could not find certain medications in pharmacies started surfacing in early March, shortly after Moscow unleashed a war on Ukraine, and sweeping sanctions left Russia increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Patient’s Monitor, a patients' rights group in the Russian region of Dagestan on the Caspian Sea, began getting complaints in the second week of March. Ziyautdin Uvaysov, head of the group, told AP he personally checked with several state-run pharmacies in the region on the availability of 10 most-wanted medications and ""they didn’t have a large number of these.” Uvaysov added that when he asked about when supplies would be restocked, the pharmacies replied that ""there aren’t any and it’s unclear when there will be.” Despite assurances from authorities that hoarding of supplies was to blame for the quickly emptying shelves, reports about shortages persisted throughout March. Vrachi.Rf, one of Russia’s biggest online communities for medical workers, surveyed more than 3,000 doctors in mid-March, and they said they had run into shortages of more than 80 medications: anti-inflammatory, gastrointestinal, antiepileptic and anticonvulsant drugs, as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics. About a dozen people contacted by the AP in different cities in late March said they had spent days searching for certain thyroid medications, types of insulin or even a popular pain-relieving syrup for children. Some said they were unable to find them at all. “Patients I treat have lost some blood pressure medications,” Erlikh said. “And some doctors I know are reporting problems with certain very expensive, very important medications (used in) certain surgical procedures.” Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has repeatedly given assurances that drug availability is not a problem in the country and has blamed any shortages on panic-buying. He said the demand for certain drugs has spiked tenfold in recent weeks, and he has urged Russians not to hoard the medications. Experts agree that panic-buying has played a role in creating drug shortages. “People rushed to stock up, and in some cases, supplies that were supposed to last a year or a year and a half were bought out within a month,” Nikolay Bespalov, development director of the RNC Pharma analytical company, told AP. Bespalov also pointed to logistical problems that occurred early in the crisis. While major Western pharmaceutical companies pledged not to withdraw vital medications from the Russian market, sanctions cut Russia’s key banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, hindering international payments. Dozens of countries halted air traffic with Russia, disrupting supply chains. The expert stressed the logistical issues have been largely resolved, but panic-buying, prompted by fears that foreign companies will halt supplies, may continue fueling shortages for some time. “Clearly, until the emotions calm down, it will continue,” Bespalov said. Local news sites — from Vladimir, just east of Moscow, to the Kemerovo region in Siberia — reported shortages of various medications in the final days of March amid continued panic-buying. Russia’s health care watchdog Roszdravnadzor, however, said in a statement Friday that “the situation on the drug market is gradually returning to normal, panic-buying of pharmaceuticals is decreasing.” Erlikh, the cardiologist, pointed to already-existing problems with quality medications in Russia, which according to some estimates imports up to 40% of its drugs. After authorities launched an import substitution policy to counter sanctions over the 2014 annexation of Crimea and to promote its own medications over foreign-made ones, shortages of certain imported drugs became a problem. The policy outlined a wide range of preferences to Russian businesses and eventually made it unprofitable for foreign pharmaceutical companies to supply some of their expensive, high-quality drugs to Russia. In 2015, state procurement of drugs for hospitals and state-funded clinics, which account for up to 80% of Russia’s pharmaceutical market, became subject to the “three’s a crowd” rule, which excluded foreign businesses if at least two Russian companies were bidding for a contract. The government also kept adding more drugs to the “vital medicines” list -- a registry of over 800 essential drugs, for which the authorities set obligatory — and relatively low — prices. Companies can apply for changing the set price once a year, but the process is long, heavily bureaucratic and doesn't lead to a guaranteed result. “We have already been gradually losing one important original medication after another. Generics are taking their place, and while there are some rather good ones made in Europe, there are also some dubious ones made in Russia,” Erlikh said. “Of course, when there is no original medication, a generic is better than nothing. But it is a situation of (deliberately) lowering the bar, it is not a good way to live,” he added. ——— Follow AP’s coverage of Russia and Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",3
"GOP Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire said Donald Trump is “crazy” and joked that if the former Republican president was admitted to a mental hospital, he’s not getting out WASHINGTON -- GOP Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire said Donald Trump is “crazy” and joked that if the former Republican president was admitted to a mental hospital, “he ain't getting out!” Sununu skewered Trump during the Gridiron Club’s spring dinner Saturday night, an annual Washington gathering featuring skits and speeches from Democrats, Republicans and journalists that are expected to “singe” but “not burn” the capital's political elite. “He’s (expletive) crazy!” Sununu said in salty remarks that roasted members of both parties as well as the Washington journalists who cover them. The governor added: ""The press often will ask me if I think Donald Trump is crazy. And I’ll say it this way: I don’t think he’s so crazy that you could put him in a mental institution. But I think if he were in one, he ain’t getting out!” Sununu also spoke of being left astonished by an encounter with Trump when the former president was visiting New Hampshire for a political rally. After greeting Trump at the airport, Sununu said Trump insisted he ride with him to the venue. Sununu said that Trump spent most of the ride obsessing over his polling numbers, but at one point broke his train of thought to point out that all the people holding American flags along the motorcade route were his fans. Trump pointed to one man with a flag and sign before Trump returned to the topic of polling, Sununu recalled. “I can’t help but notice the guy he pointed at, the sign he’s holding says, '(expletive, Trump!),” Sununu joked. In his Gridiron address, Sununu also took aim at Democrats and poked fun at himself. He said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who is reportedly set to sign a deal soon to join MSNBC, would be smart to get her money upfront considering the network’s ratings. Sununu noted he was included in a Washington Post list of 10 potential 2024 GOP presidential contenders. He cracked that his vast foreign policy experience included building a short wall with polite signage on New Hampshire’s border with Canada. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who spoke on behalf of Democrats at the dinner, remarked that he had not heard a “Republican use the F-word that much since the Nixon administration.” “But I’ve got to say that Gov. Sununu's eloquent profanity is the kind of insurrection the GOP needs today,"" Raskin said. The sitting president typically attends the event. President Joe Biden, who spent the weekend in his home state of Delaware, skipped but sent a video message. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo delivered remarks on behalf of the administration. Republicans last year made a pitch to Sununu to challenge incumbent Democrat Sen. Maggie Hassan in 2022, but he ultimately declined and opted to run for reelection as governor. The seat is one of several that Republicans are eyeing as they look to win control of the Senate in upcoming midterm elections. Sununu told the Washington Examiner that after hearing GOP leadership’s plan for the next two years, he decided wasn’t interested in simply being a “roadblock” to Biden’s agenda.",6
"Pope Francis is praying for an end to the “sacrilegious” war in Ukraine and for the world to show compassion to refugees VALLETTA, Malta -- Pope Francis prayed Sunday for an end to the “sacrilegious” war in Ukraine and for the world to show compassion to refugees as he concluded a two-day visit to Malta that was dominated by his concern for the devastation unleashed by Russia’s invasion. “May we be tireless in praying and in offering assistance to those who suffer,” Francis said at the end of a Mass in Valletta, the capital of Malta, that drew 20,000 people, some of them waiving Ukrainian flags. More Ukrainian flags greeted him outside a migrant shelter, where Ukrainian protesters shouted “Save our children!” and “Close the sky over Ukraine!” Francis has used his two-day visit to Malta to drive home his call for Europe to show compassion to would-be refugees who cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya. He has expanded that message to express his gratitude for the welcome Europe has shown Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian war and his hope that same generosity could be extended to others. Though short, the trip has been particularly taxing for the 85-year-old pontiff, who is suffering from a chronic strained ligament in his right knee. He struggled repeatedly Sunday to get out of his chair and his limping gait from sciatica was so pronounced that he frequently had to grab the arm of an aide. Francis opened his second and final day in Malta by visiting the Grotto of St. Paul in Rabat, where the Apostle Paul stayed after being shipwrecked off Malta en route to Rome in AD 60. According to the biblical account of the period, the Maltese people showed Paul unusual kindness, and he responded by preaching and healing, bringing Christianity to the islands. Francis referred to that warm welcome Malta showed Christ’s shipwrecked disciple, meeting with recent migrants from Africa who paid smugglers to try to reach Europe to escape war and conflict. He told them that they “could be any one of us.” “It is my hope that that is how Malta will always treat those who land on its shores, offering them a genuinely ‘safe harbor,’” he said. Malta has long been at the heart of the European debate over refugee policy. The country of a half-million is frequently criticized by humanitarian groups for refusing to let rescue ships dock at its ports. The government argues it has one of the EU’s highest rates in processing first-time asylum applications relative to the population, and says other, bigger European countries should do more to shoulder the burden. Just this week, a German aid group urged Malta to take in 106 migrants rescued off Libya. Malta demurred and on Saturday, the mayor of Palermo, Sicily, said the city was ready to welcome them. While Francis has praised Malta’s response overall, some migrants at the Peace Lab social service center said they had been waiting for years for their asylum claims to be processed and that Malta really doesn’t work to integrate them. “I need an ID card,” said Agyei Kwasi Batig, a Ghanaian who has been living in Malta for eight years. “In Europe, if you don’t have an ID card, you suffer. For everything, you need documents.” Francis’ Mass, his biggest event in Malta, drew an estimated 20,000 people. They clapped when Francis urged the faithful in a final prayer to “think of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in the martyred Ukraine, which continues to be bombarded in this sacrilegious war.” Among those in the crowd was Alina Shcherbyna, a 25-year-old Ukrainian who arrived in Malta just over a week ago after fleeing her bombed-out home in Dnipro, leaving behind her parents, who are both doctors. An Orthodox Christian, she said she was attending the Mass to accompany the Maltese host family who took her in after a solo train and bus journey that took her to Poland, Germany and the Netherlands before she flew to Malta. Carrying Ukrainian and Vatican flags, Shcherbyna said she wanted to ask the pope and the world for prayers for Ukraine, saying she still cannot believe what has happened in just a few weeks. “At school we were studying a lot about the Second World War, about bomb shelters and about this disaster, and we thought it was impossible in present time. We thought it had ended in 1945 and that was it. But now, it’s really shocking for all of us,” she said. Another Ukrainian Orthodox in the crowd, Margaryta Gromova, fled recently from Kyiv and thanked Francis for speaking out. “He can really speak about this issue, he can pray for us,” she said. “We can feel the unity with other people, local people, the world, because we need support, like moral support, and all the support from God now.” ——— Follow all AP stories about developments related to the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine. ——— Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

"The shooting occurred just blocks from the state Capitol building.  At least 16 shot in Sacramento mass shooting  At least 18 people were injured, six fatally, when a mass shooting erupted early Sunday in downtown Sacramento, California, and police said no suspects were in custody. The Sacramento Police Department said several streets in downtown Sacramento just blocks from the state Capitol building and the Golden 1 Center where the Kings NBA team plays were closed as officers responded to the gun violence. The conditions of the victims were not immediately known, police said. Three of the deceased are men, and three are women, Sacramento Police Chief Kathy Lester said during a press conference Sunday afternoon. A fight took place just before the shootings, and there were multiple shooters, Lester said, adding that is not currently known whether the shooters were a part of the same party or were unknown to each other. Investigators are interviewing several witnesses and sifting through hundreds of pieces of evidence, Lester said. The shooting came just several hours after one person was killed and 10 people were injured when gunfire erupted at an outdoor concert in Dallas, Texas. The Sacramento shooting broke out about 2 a.m. near the corner of 10th and K Street in a popular nightlife area, Sacramento Police Chief Kathy Lester said at a news conference. Lester said police officers were in the area and heard the gunshot. ""We had a large crowd in the area. We don't know if it was part of a club or an event,"" Lester said. She said officers immediately responded and began providing medical aid to victims. In a statement Sunday afternoon, police said six people were fatally shot and another 12 were injured and taken to hospitals. Lester asked for the public's help in identifying the suspect or suspects involved in the shooting, saying no one was in custody. Pamela Harris of Sacramento told ABC News that her son, Sergio Harris, a married father of two daughters, was among those killed. She said she went to the scene of the shooting at about 2:30 a.m. after getting a call from someone who is not in law enforcement, informing her that her 38-year-old son was among those killed. ""My son was a very vivacious young man, fun to be around, liked to party, have fun, smiling all the time, didn't bother people. For this to happen ... it's crazy,"" Harris told reporters at the scene. ""I'm just to the point right now I don't know what to do. I don't even think this is real. I feel like it's a dream."" President Joe Biden released a statement Sunday night, condemning the shootings and calling on Congress to pass measures to combat gun violence. ""Today, America once again mourns for another community devastated by gun violence,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Families forever changed. Survivors left to heal wounds both visible and invisible."" ""Ban ghost guns. Require background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability,"" Biden's statement continued. ""Pass my budget proposal, which would give cities more of the funding they need to fund the police and fund the crime prevention and intervention strategies that can make our cities safer."" Community activist Berry Accius of Voice of the Youth said he arrived at the scene at about 2:30 a.m. after a city council member called him about the shooting. ""It was just horrific,"" Accius told ABC affiliate station KXTV in Sacramento. ""Just as soon as I walked up you saw a chaotic scene, police all over the place, victims with blood all over their bodies, folks screaming, folks crying, people going, 'Where is my brother?' Mothers crying and trying to identify who their child was."" Video posted on Twitter showed people running through the street as the apparent sound of rapid gunfire could be heard in the background. ""Please avoid the area as a large police presence will remain and the scene remains active,"" police officials said in a statement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said it is assisting the Sacramento Police Department in the investigation. Sacramento police asked anyone in the area at the time of the shooting to submit to investigators any photos and video, or other evidence linked to the violence. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg condemned the shooting during a news conference Sunday afternoon in downtown Sacramento. ""This is a senseless and unacceptable tragedy. And I emphasize the word unacceptable,"" Steinberg said. ""Thoughts and prayers are not nearly enough. We must do more as a city as a state and as a nation. This senseless epidemic of gun violence must be addressed. How many unending tragedies does it take before we begin to cure the sickness in this country? Let us be honest, this is a sickness."" California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his wife, Jennifer, issued a statement, saying he was monitoring the shooting and that his administration is working closely with law enforcement. ""Sadly, we once again mourn the lives lost and for those injured in yet another horrendous act of gun violence. Jennifer and I send our heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, and to the wider community impacted by this terrible tragedy,"" Newsom's statement reads. ""What we do know at this point is that another mass casualty shooting has occurred, leaving families with lost loved ones, multiple individuals injured and a community in grief. The scourge of gun violence continues to be a crisis in our country, and we must resolve to bring an end to this carnage.""

"Russia’s devastating war on Ukraine is bringing a whole set of new problems to the global auto industry, just as it was starting to recover from the pandemic and computer chip shortages DETROIT -- BMW has halted production at two German factories. Mercedes is slowing work at its assembly plants. Volkswagen, warning of production stoppages, is looking for alternative sources for parts. For more than a year, the global auto industry has struggled with a disastrous shortage of computer chips and other vital parts that has shrunk production, slowed deliveries and sent prices for new and used cars soaring beyond reach for millions of consumers. Now, a new factor — Russia’s war against Ukraine — has thrown up yet another obstacle. Critically important electrical wiring, made in Ukraine, is suddenly out of reach. With buyer demand high, materials scarce and the war causing new disruptions, vehicle prices are expected to head even higher well into next year. The war’s damage to the auto industry has emerged first in Europe. But U.S. production will likely suffer eventually, too, if Russian exports of metals — from palladium for catalytic converters to nickel for electric vehicle batteries — are cut off. “You only need to miss one part not to be able to make a car,” said Mark Wakefield, co-leader of consulting firm Alix Partners’ global automotive unit. “Any bump in the road becomes either a disruption of production or a vastly unplanned-for cost increase.” Supply problems have bedeviled automakers since the pandemic erupted two years ago, at times shuttering factories and causing vehicle shortages. The robust recovery that followed the recession caused demand for autos to vastly outstrip supply — a mismatch that sent prices for new and used vehicles skyrocketing well beyond overall high inflation. In the United States, the average price of a new vehicle is up 13% in the past year, to $45,596, according to Edmunds.com. Average used prices have surged far more: They’re up 29% to $29,646 as of February. Before the war, S&P Global Mobility had predicted that global automakers would build 84 million vehicles this year and 91 million next year. (By comparison, they built 94 million in 2018.) Now it’s forecasting fewer than 82 million in 2022 and 88 million next year. Mark Fulthorpe, an executive director for S&P, is among analysts who think the availability of new vehicles in North America and Europe will remain severely tight — and prices high — well into 2023. Compounding the problem, buyers who are priced out of the new-vehicle market will intensify demand for used autos and keep those prices elevated, too — prohibitively so for many households. Eventually, high inflation across the economy — for food, gasoline, rent and other necessities — will likely leave a vast number of ordinary buyers unable to afford a new or used vehicle. Demand would then wane. And so, eventually, would prices. “Until inflationary pressures start to really erode consumer and business capabilities,” Fulthorpe said, “it’s probably going to mean that those who have the inclination to buy a new vehicle, they’ll be prepared to pay top dollar.” One factor behind the dimming outlook for production is the shuttering of auto plants in Russia. Last week, French automaker Renault, one of the last automakers that have continued to build in Russia, said it would suspend production in Moscow. The transformation of Ukraine into an embattled war zone has hurt, too. Wells Fargo estimates that 10% to 15% of crucial wiring harnesses that supply vehicle production in the vast European Union were made in Ukraine. In the past decade, automakers and parts companies invested in Ukrainian factories to limit costs and gain proximity to European plants. The wiring shortage has slowed factories in Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and elsewhere, leading S&P to slash its forecast for worldwide auto production by 2.6 million vehicles for both this year and next. The shortages could reduce exports of German vehicles to the United States and elsewhere. Wiring harnesses are bundles of wires and connectors that are unique to each model; they can't be easily re-sourced to another parts maker. Despite the war, harness makers like Aptiv and Leoni have managed to reopen factories sporadically in Western Ukraine. Still Joseph Massaro, Aptiv’s chief financial officer, acknowledged that Ukraine “is not open for any type of normal commercial activity.” Aptiv, based in Dublin, is trying to shift production to Poland, Romania, Serbia and possibly Morocco. But the process will take up to six weeks, leaving some automakers short of parts during that time. “Long term,” Massaro told analysts, “we’ll have to assess if and when it makes sense to go back to Ukraine.” BMW is trying to coordinate with its Ukrainian suppliers and is casting a wider net for parts. So are Mercedes and Volkswagen. Yet finding alternative supplies may be next to impossible. Most parts plants are operating close to capacity, so new work space would have to be built. Companies would need months to hire more people and add work shifts. ""The training process to bring up to speed a new workforce — it’s not an overnight thing,” Fulthorpe said. Fulthorpe said he foresees a further tightening supply of materials from both Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine is the world’s largest exporter of neon, a gas used in lasers that etch circuits onto computer chips. Most chip makers have a six-month supply; late in the year, they could run short. That would worsen the chip shortage, which before the war had been delaying production even more than automakers expected. Likewise, Russia is a key supplier of such raw materials as platinum and palladium, used in pollution-reducing catalytic converters. Russia also produces 10% of the world’s nickel, an essential ingredient in EV batteries. Mineral supplies from Russia haven’t been shut off yet. Recycling might help ease the shortage. Other countries may increase production. And some manufacturers have stockpiled the metals. But Russia also is a big aluminum producer, and a source of pig iron, used to make steel. Nearly 70% of U.S. pig iron imports come from Russia and Ukraine, Alix Partners says, so steelmakers will need to switch to production from Brazil or use alternative materials. In the meantime, steel prices have rocketed up from $900 a ton a few weeks ago to $1,500 now. So far, negotiations toward a cease-fire in Ukraine have gone nowhere, and the fighting has raged on. A new virus surge in China could cut into parts supplies, too. Industry analysts say they have no clear idea when parts, raw materials and auto production will flow normally. Even if a deal is negotiated to suspend fighting, sanctions against Russian exports would remain intact until after a final agreement had been reached. Even then, supplies wouldn’t start flowing normally. Fulthorpe said there would be “further hangovers because of disruption that will take place in the widespread supply chains.” Wakefield noted, too, that because of intense pent-up demand for vehicles across the world, even if automakers restore full production, the process of building enough vehicles will be a protracted one. When might the world produce an ample enough supply of cars and trucks to meet demand and keep prices down? Wakefield doesn’t profess to know. “We’re in a raising-price environment, a (production)-constrained environment,” he said. “That’s a weird thing for the auto industry.” ——— Chan reported from London.",6
"Pope Francis says he is still working on arranging a meeting with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, despite that leader's seeming justification for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE -- Pope Francis said Sunday he was still working on arranging a meeting with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, despite that leader's seeming justification for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and said he wouldn't rule out travelling to the region if it would help. Speaking to reporters en route home from Malta, Francis said he and Patriarch Kirill were thinking of a possible location in the Middle East. But he provided no details other than to recall that they spoke by video on March 16. Kirill has called for peace and for civilians to be spared but has seemingly justified Russia’s invasion by casting it as a “metaphysical” battle with the West and its “gay parades."" His insistence that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people” is echoed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Francis was asked what he would say to Putin if they were to speak by phone, and recalled what he had told Maltese leaders upon his arrival on Saturday. In the speech, Francis blasted the “potentate” for his “infantile and destructive aggression” that he had justified under the guise of “anachronistic claims of nationalist interests.” Still, he did not name Putin in the speech. Francis stressed that he had no immediate plans for a visit to Kyiv but that a proposal was “on the table.” “I said the availability is always there. There is not a ‘No,’” he said. But he stressed that any such trip would have to be evaluated to see if it would help or not, or could even be done. And he said if it was determined that it could help, “I must do it.” He paid tribute to the reporters who have died covering the conflict, saying they were providing a courageous service for the common good. “I want to offer condolences for your colleagues who have fallen, no matter what side, I don’t care,"" he said. ""Your work is a work for the common good. They died in service of the common good: information. We wont forget them. They were courageous. I pray for them, and may the Lord reward their work.” Francis was also asked about his health, given his clear struggles walking during the two-day trip to Malta. He used an elevator to board and descend from the plane, and at times he needed assistance getting up from his chair. “My health is a bit capricious,” he said. “I have this problem with my knee which makes problems of mobility and walking. It’s a bit painful. But it’s getting better. At least I can move.” He revealed that a few weeks ago, he couldn’t walk — an apparent reference to the rest ordered up by his doctors that forced the cancellation of a trip to Florence and Francis’ participation in an Ash Wednesday procession. “We’ll see if I go back (to that),” he said. “There’s some doubt because at this age, you don’t know how it’ll end up. We’ll hope it turns out OK.” ——— Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

"Sacramento's police chief says multiple shooters opened fire in the city's downtown, killing six people and injuring 12 as bars closed for the night SACRAMENTO, Calif -- At least two shooters opened fire early Sunday in Sacramento in the city's second mass shooting in five weeks, killing six people and wounding 12 others as bars closed for the night and crowds emptied onto downtown streets, police said. Three men and three women were killed, Police Chief Kathy Lester said. Their bodies remained on the pavement hours after the gunfire erupted around 2 a.m. Police sought clues from a crime scene that stretched across multiple city blocks as they searched for the shooters. At least four of the wounded were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries. Authorities have not offered a possible motive and have so far identified only one victim, 38-year-old Sergio Harris, without providing a cause of death. His sister Kay Harris, 32, told The Associated Press just hours after the shooting that she had been asleep when a family member called to say they thought her brother had been killed. She said she thought Sergio Harris had been at the London nightclub, which is near the shooting. Pamela Harris, Sergio Harris’ mother, told The Sacramento Bee the family had not heard from him since the shooting. “We just want to know what happened to him,” she said early Sunday. “Not knowing anything is just hard to face.” Investigators pored through hundreds of pieces of evidence — much of it documented on the streets with blue and yellow markers — as officials begged the public to come forward with tips and videos that could help find the suspects. Councilmember Katie Valenzuela, who represents the area, said she’s fielded many phone calls reporting violence in her district during her 15 months in office. She cried at a news conference as she told reporters that the latest phone call woke her up at 2:30 a.m. “I’m heartbroken and I’m outraged,” she said. “Our community deserves better than this.” Sunday’s violence was the third time this year in the U.S. that at least six people have been killed in a mass shooting, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. President Joe Biden called for action on gun crimes in a statement Sunday. “Today, America once again mourns for another community devastated by gun violence,” Biden said. “But we must do more than mourn; we must act.” Sacramento has endured two mass shootings in the last five weeks . On Feb. 28, a father killed his three daughters, a chaperone and himself in a Sacramento church during a weekly supervised visitation. David Mora, 39, was armed with a homemade semiautomatic rifle-style weapon, even though he was under a restraining order that prohibited him from possessing a firearm. The area where Sunday's killings occurred is on the outskirts of the city's main entertainment district and has many bars and restaurants. It's anchored by the Golden One Center that attracts big-name concerts and is home to the NBA’s Sacramento Kings. City officials have invested heavily in the area to promote development. Videos on social media showed what appeared to be an altercation before the gunfire in California's capital city. Sgt. Zach Eaton, a police spokesperson, said investigators don’t know if that fight led to the shooting. Kelsey Schar was staying on the fourth floor of Citizen Hotel when she said she heard gunshots and saw flashes in the dark. She walked to the window and “saw a guy running and just shooting,” Schar told the AP. Her friend, Madalyn Woodard, said she saw a crowd in the street scatter amid the gunfire and a girl who appeared to have been shot in the arm lying on the ground. Security guards from a nearby nightclub rushed to help the girl with what looked like napkins to try to stanch the bleeding. A video posted on Twitter showed people running through the street amid the sounds of rapid gunfire. Nightclubs close at 2 a.m. and it’s typical for streets to be full of people at that hour in the city of about 525,000 people, located 75 miles (120 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco. Pop duo Aly & AJ performed Saturday at Sacramento’s Crest Theatre and their tour bus was caught in the gunfire, the musicians said on Twitter. No one in their touring group was hurt, the tweet said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that his administration was working closely with law enforcement officials. “What we do know at this point is that another mass casualty shooting has occurred, leaving families with lost loved ones, multiple individuals injured and a community in grief,” he said. Berry Accius, a community activist, said he came to the scene shortly after the shooting happened. “The first thing I saw was like victims. I saw a young girl with a whole bunch of blood in her body, a girl taking off glass from her, a young girl screaming saying, ‘They killed my sister.’ A mother running up, ‘Where’s my son, has my son been shot?’“ he said. Mayor Darrell Steinberg said in recent years it “has been a very difficult time in downtown Sacramento,” as the city’s development efforts took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic. He added that the shooting “gives pause to our entire community,” but he urged people to continue visiting the area. ——— Associated Press writers David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",6
"The luxury rental property has ""gorgeous ocean views,"" according to its listing. Federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s tax affairs  Hunter Biden is apparently spending his father's presidency living in luxury in Malibu -- and so is his taxpayer-funded security detail. The Secret Service detail protecting the president's controversial son has been paying more than $30,000 a month to rent out a swanky Malibu, California, mansion for nearly a year, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The agency responsible for protecting the president and his family -- among other ranking government officials -- selected the property in order to be located as close as possible to Biden's own rented mansion where he is paying about $20,000 a month according to property listings, sources told ABC News. Retired senior Secret Service agent Don Mihalek, now an ABC News contributor, said the arrangement is ""the cost of doing business for the Secret Service,"" adding that under the federal law, the agency has a mandated protective responsibility for the president, the first family, and anybody else the president designates for protection. ""Typically, wherever a protectee sets up their residence, the Secret Service is forced to find someplace to rent nearby at market value,"" Mihalek said, noting that the agency is also renting out properties to protect President Joe Biden's residences in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. ""This isn't new,"" Mihalek said. ""The Service has had to do this in past administrations, and unfortunately, the housing market right now has driven the prices up substantially."" A White House official referred ABC News to the Secret Service for comment. Asked about the cost of the protection, a representative for the Secret Service said only: ""Due to the need to maintain operational security, the U.S. Secret Service does not comment on the means, methods, or resources used to conduct our protective operations."" A representative for Hunter Biden did not respond to requests for comment from ABC News. Hunter Biden's California lifestyle is coming into focus just as the federal probe into his tax affairs has intensified, as sources familiar with the matter recently told ABC News. An increasing number of witnesses have appeared before a grand jury impaneled in Wilmington, Delaware, in recent months, the sources said, and have been asked about payments Hunter Biden received while serving on the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, in addition to other questions about how Biden paid off tax obligations in recent years. ""In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,"" Hunter Biden told ABC News anchor Amy Robach in October 2019, regarding serving on the board of Burisma and the impact of his foreign business dealings on his father's political career. ""Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is ... a swamp in -- in -- in many ways? Yeah."" The younger Biden, along with other members of the Biden family, began to receive around-the-clock protection from the Secret Service when Joe Biden became the Democratic presidential nominee in June 2020. The family was provided a more robust security detail once the elder Biden won the presidency, which is customary for all immediate members of a president's family. In Malibu, Hunter Biden's digs include a four-bedroom, three-bathroom ""resort-style"" home with an open floor plan, vaulted high ceilings, chef's kitchen and French doors, according to a description on its property listing. The mansion also features a ""spacious park-like yard"" with a pool, a spa, a built-in barbecue bar, and alfresco dining, according to the listing. The property is located on 0.7 acres atop a hill, and boasts ""enchanting"" 180-degree panoramic ocean views, the listing says. Next door is where sources say Biden's team of Secret Service agents are living and working. The Spanish-style estate that the Secret Service has rented sits on a 0.7-acre lot above the Malibu coast and also features ""gorgeous ocean views,"" according to its listing. With six bedrooms, six bathrooms, a gym, a tasting room, a built-in barbecue, a pool, a spa, and a spiral staircase that leads up to a ""castle-like tower to the master retreat with wet bar,"" the luxury mansion boasts ""resort style living at its finest"" and is ""a perfect retreat for discerning clientele,"" its listing says. The cost of protecting first families has raised eyebrows in the past. In the first year of Donald Trump's presidency, the Secret Service requested $60 million of additional funding to protect Trump and his family, with about $27 million of that going to protecting them at their private residency at the Trump Tower in New York City, according to internal agency documents obtained by the Washington Post at that time. Throughout Trump's presidency, his family business came under fire for bringing in revenue from the Secret Service by charging for space at various Trump properties across the globe that agents used while protecting Trump and his family members. The total amount that the Secret Service has paid to Trump's family business to date is difficult to pin down, but according to an analysis by the Washington Post, records that have been released so far show that the Secret Service has spent at least $1.2 million at various Trump properties while protecting the Trump family, from $650 per night for a room at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club to $17,000 a month for a cottage at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey. Numerous overseas business trips taken by Trump's elder sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, also came under scrutiny during Trump's presidency for costing the Secret Service hundreds of thousands of dollars each time, records show. And the security detail that protected Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner cost taxpayers $3,000 a month for the rental of a studio apartment across from the couple's Washington, D.C., home throughout Trump's presidency, sources confirmed to ABC News at the time. During the Obama presidency, both of President Barack Obama's daughters lived in the White House and the president himself visited his private residence in Chicago only a handful of times -- but his family made regular visits to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and took family trips to Honolulu during Christmas, costing the Secret Service millions of dollars each time. According to spending records obtained by the right-leaning watchdog group Judicial Watch, the Obama family's trip to Martha's Vineyard in August 2016 cost the Secret Service a whopping $2.7 million, including $2.5 million in hotels and $90,000 in rental cars, while the family's final Christmas trip to Honolulu in late 2016 cost the agency $1.9 million, including $1.8 million in hotels. First Lady Michelle Obama's trips to Aspen in 2014, 2015 and 2016 cost the Secret Service more than $319,000 in taxpayer money, including nearly $166,000 incurred from the 2016 trip, records obtained by the group show. And Joe Biden, as vice president during Obama's presidency, collected $2,200 a month in payments from the Secret Service by renting out a cottage on his Delaware property for the agents protecting him, according to past media reports and federal spending records. Of the high cost sometimes associated with protecting presidential family members, Mihalek said, ""I think it's all relative."" ""Hunter's out in Malibu, which is not a low-cost area,"" said Mihalek. ""And the Trump kids, too, they didn't live in low-cost areas."" Mihalek said that for the Secret Service to do their job effectively, they have to have a command post near the protectee -- even if it costs more. ""The Secret Service couldn't have a command post in the next town over,"" he said. ""It'd do them no good."" Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at progressive good-government group Public Citizen, told ABC News that Secret Service Protection is necessary for the president and the president's family -- but that they should recognize that the agency is there for their own protection and help lower the cost to taxpayers by reducing unnecessary travel or by sharing their own properties free of charge. ""Ivanka and Jared should have opened up their house to the Secret Service, just as Hunter Biden should do at his Malibu residence,"" Holman said. ""Hunter should recognize the exorbitant cost of his own protection in the exclusive Malibu neighborhood, and cooperate with the Secret Service to bring down the expenses,"" said Holman. ""A cost of $30,000 a month for the Secret Service to rent a home in Malibu next to Hunter is an unconscionable burden to taxpayers, all for the personal benefit of Hunter Biden. Hunter should realize this and accommodate his security detail in his own home.""",1
"Over two year old border restrictions, known as Title 42, end next month.  Biden administration to end border restrictions  The TAKE with Rick Klein A deteriorating political environment means no shortage of small things that can become big things as well as big things that become all-encompassing and devastating. Enter the Biden administration's announcement that strict pandemic border restrictions that have been in place for more than two years, known as Title 42, will end next month. The move has brought predictions of a fresh surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border -- and fears of worsening politics surrounding COVID-19, crime and immigration all in time for the midterms. On ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said the decision to revoke the order, which has been used to quickly expel most migrants apprehended at the border since the start of the pandemic, belongs to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""It's a public-health law,"" Klain said, adding that the CDC's judgment is that by late May, ""the pandemic will be a place where we can no longer exclude people on a public-health rationale. But the mantra of ""follow the science"" doesn't necessarily square with other Biden administration guidance. As Republicans have been quick to point out, taking a flight or using public transportation still requires masking up, even while virtually all U.S. jurisdictions have dropped mask mandates. As some Democrats have been quick to point out, a dramatic change in policy now could worsen a border crisis and strain agencies and communities. A letter sent to President Joe Biden by Arizona Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema on March 24 stated that the senators ""have not yet seen evidence that DHS has developed and implemented a sufficient plan to maintain a humane and orderly process in the event of an end to Title 42."" Biden aides are loath to admit it, but the Trump-initiated policy at the border has provided political cover in addition to operational authority many Democrats see as necessary policy. Blaming different federal agencies for their independent judgments is not likely to assuage concerns -- political or otherwise. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Former Alaska governor and once-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is vying for a chance to serve in Congress. Palin’s announcement comes after the March death of Rep. Don Young, who held Alaska’s at-large seat for 49 years. ""America is at a tipping point,"" Palin wrote in a Facebook announcement. ""As I've watched the far left destroy the country, I knew I had to step up and join the fight."" Palin is reemerging as a political candidate in a Republican Party that is much friendlier to her brand of populism than it was when she was named John McCain's running mate in 2008. Palin's campaign announcement is rife with the same sort of indignation that brought her to prominence 14 years ago and arguably gave way to former President Donald Trump's political rise. ""At this critical time in our nation's history, we need leaders who will combat the left's socialist, big-government, America-last agenda,"" Palin said. ""This country was built by heroes, and the radical left dishonors their legacies by opening our borders to illegal immigrants, mortgaging our children's future, and selling out our nation's interests to the highest bidder."" Palin is joining a very crowded field, as 51 candidates have filed for the chance to fill the vacancy. Her run coincides with major changes to Alaska's voting system. Palin will appear on the open primary ballot in June, and if she is among the top four candidates, she'll move to the August general election that will employ ranked-choice voting. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema  The first Democratic Senate primary debate of Pennsylvania's campaign season kicked off with three podiums and just two candidates on stage. Although the race's frontrunner, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, did not attend the Sunday afternoon event, fellow Senate contenders Rep. Connor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta launched several attacks at Fetterman in his absence. The candidates invoked the lieutenant governor's name on matters of policy and rhetoric, and both called out a 2013 incident in which Fetterman, armed with a shotgun, confronted a Black man after hearing gunfire near his home. At the time, Fetterman was the mayor of Braddock in western Pennsylvania. Since then, he acknowledged his role in the interaction, and has said he wasn't aware of the race or gender of the person he moved to ""intercept."" In the days leading up to the debate, Lamb claimed Fetterman was skipping the event because he wanted to avoid addressing what happened. Kenyatta posted a graphic with the definition of the word ""cowardice"" on Twitter in response to a headline about Fetterman sitting out the debate. On Friday, the Fetterman campaign announced he was committed to three other upcoming high-profile debates and spent Sunday meeting with voters in rural Pennsylvania. His approach to the 2022 political landscape appears to echo a broader trend of battleground candidates bucking the traditional campaign timeline in favor of setting their own priorities – and it remains to be seen which approach proves to be successful. While the repeated invocations of the 2013 incident and questions over debate participation could be a hurdle for the frontrunner as he attempts to earn support from every corner of the state's Democratic base, it also marks a shift toward negative campaigning in the otherwise quiet Democratic primary. ONE MORE THING The Secret Service detail protecting President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, has been paying more than $30,000 a month to rent out a swanky Malibu, California, mansion for nearly a year, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The agency selected the property in order to be located as close as possible to Biden's own rented mansion, where he is paying about $20,000 a month, according to property listings, sources said.

"Yearly inflation in Turkey has hit 61.14%, climbing to a new 20-year high and deepening a cost of living crisis for many households ISTANBUL -- Yearly inflation in Turkey hit 61.14% on Monday, climbing to a new 20-year high and deepening a cost of living crisis for many households. The Turkish Statistical Institute said consumer prices rose by 5.46% in March compared with the previous month. Yearly inflation was up from 54.44% in February. The highest yearly price increase was in the transportation sector, at 99.12%, while the increase in food prices was 70.33%, according to the data. It was the biggest year-on-year increase since March 2002. Rising prices are part of an economic crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has seen a surge in gas, oil and grain prices. Turkey’s runaway inflation also follows a series of interest rate cuts late last year, in line with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opposition to high borrowing costs in a bid to boost growth, investment and exports. In contrast to established economic thinking, the president insists that high rates cause inflation. The central bank cut rates by 5 percentage points between September and December but they have remained unchanged at 14% this year. The lira, which lost 44% of its value against the U.S. dollar last year, plunged to a record high of 18.41 against the greenback in December. The currency’s performance has fueled inflation in the import-reliant Turkish economy. In an effort to soften the blow on households, the government has implemented tax cuts on basic goods and has adjusted electricity tariffs.",6
"The U.S. government seized a mega yacht in Spain owned by an oligarch with close ties to the Russian president On Location: April 1, 2022 PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain -- The U.S. government seized a mega yacht in Spain owned by an oligarch with close ties to the Russian president on Monday, the first in the government’s sanctions initiative to “seize and freeze” giant boats and other pricey assets of Russian elites. Spain's Civil Guard and U.S. federal agents descended on the yacht at the Marina Real in the port of Palma de Mallorca, the capital of Spain’s Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. Associated Press reporters at the scene saw police going in and out of the boat on Monday morning. The joint operation to seize the yacht, with Spain's Civil Guard, the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations, was carried out at the request of U.S. authorities, the Civil Guard said. A Civil Guard source told The Associated Press that the immobilized yacht is Tango, a 78-meter (254-feet) vessel that carries Cook Islands flag and that Superyachtfan.com, a specialized website that tracks the world’s largest and most exclusive recreational boats, values at $120 million. The source was also not authorized to be named in media reports and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The yacht is among the assets linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate encompassing metals, mining, tech and other assets, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. All of Vekselberg’s assets in the U.S. are frozen and U.S. companies are forbidden from doing business with him and his entities. While Vekselberg has not been sanctioned by the European Union, he is under investigation in the U.S. for possible tax fraud, money laundering and falsifying documents precisely to hide the ownership of the Tango yacht, the Civil Guard said in a statement. The move is the first time the U.S. government has seized an oligarch’s yacht since Attorney General Merrick Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen assembled a task force known as REPO — short for Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs — as an effort to enforce sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S. including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Vekselberg was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and has worked closely with his American cousin, Andrew Intrater, who heads the New York investment management firm Columbus Nova. Vekselberg and Intrater were thrust into the spotlight in the Mueller probe after the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels released a memo that claimed $500,000 in hush money was routed through Columbus Nova to a shell company set up by Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Columbus Nova denied that Vekselberg played any role in its payments to Cohen. Vekselberg and Intrater met with Cohen at Trump Tower, one of several meetings between members of Trump's inner circle and high-level Russians during the 2016 campaign and transition. The 64-year-old mogul founded Renova Group more than three decades ago. The group holds the largest stake in United Co. Rusal, Russia’s biggest aluminum producer, among other investments. Vekselberg was first sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018, and again in March of this year, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began. Vekselberg has also been sanctioned by authorities in the United Kingdom. The yacht sails under Cook Islands flag and is owned by a company registered in the British Virgin Islands administered by different societies in Panama, the Civil Guard said, “following a complicated financial and societal web to conceal its truthful ownership.” Agents confiscated documents and computers inside the yacht that will be analyzed to confirm he real identity of the owner, it said. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a sanctions enforcement task force known as KleptoCapture, which also aims to enforce financial restrictions in the U.S. imposed on Russia and its billionaires, working with the FBI, Treasury and other federal agencies. That task force will also target financial institutions and entities that have helped oligarchs move money to dodge sanctions. The White House has said that many allied countries, including German, the U.K, France, Italy and others are involved in trying to collect and share information against Russians targeted for sanctions. In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden warned oligarch that the U.S. and European allies would “find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets.” “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” he said. Monday's capture is not the first time Spanish authorities have been involved in the seizure of a Russian oligarch’s superyacht. Officials there said they had seized a vessel valued at over $140 million owned by the CEO of a state-owned defense conglomerate and a close Putin ally. French authorities have also seized superyachts, including one believed to belong to Igor Sechin, a Putin ally who runs Russian oil giant Rosneft, which has been on the U.S. sanctions list since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Italy has also seized several yachts and other assets. Italian financial police moved quickly seizing the superyacht “Lena” belonging to Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch close to Putin, in the port of San Remo; the 65-meter (215-foot) “Lady M” owned by Alexei Mordashov in nearby Imperia, featuring six suites and estimated to be worth 65 million euros; as well as villas in Tuscany and Como, according to government officials. —— Parra reported from Madrid and Balsamo reported from Washington.",3
"Russia is facing a fresh wave of condemnation after evidence emerged of what appeared to be deliberate killings of civilians in Ukraine Ukrainian, Russian refugees seek asylum at border BUCHA, Ukraine -- Russia faced a fresh wave of condemnation on Monday after evidence emerged of what appeared to be deliberate killings of civilians in Ukraine. Some Western leaders called for further sanctions in response, even as Moscow continued to press its offensive in the country's east. European allies, though united in outrage, appeared split on how to respond. Poland, which is on Ukraine's border and has taken in large numbers of refugees, angrily singled out France and Germany for not taking more strident action and urged Europe to quickly wean itself off Russian energy, while Berlin said it would take a longer-term approach. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in towns around the capital, Kyiv, that were recaptured from Russian forces in recent days. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, Associated Press journalists saw 21 bodies, including a group of nine in civilian clothes who appeared to have been shot at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, AP journalists saw the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range and thrown into a pit. Residents said the mayor, her son, and her husband — who had been bound and blindfolded — were among them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his first reported foray outside the capital since the war began, visiting Bucha on Monday to meet with residents. There, he denounced the killings as “genocide” and “war crimes.” Olena Kolesnik, who fled Kharkiv for Poland, echoed that assessment. “This is genocide, this is fascism. This is the extermination of people, innocent people, children, women, and the elderly,” she said, while also describing her hometown in Ukraine’s north as being in a state of ruin after weeks of shelling. The images of battered corpses lying in the streets or hastily dug graves unleashed a wave of outrage that could signal a turning point in the nearly 6-week-old war. But sanctions have thus far failed to halt the offensive, and rising energy prices along with tight controls on the Russian currency market have blunted their impact, with the ruble rebounding strongly after initially crashing. Western and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of war crimes before, and the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor has opened a probe to investigate the conflict. But the latest reports ratcheted up the condemnation even further, with Zelenskyy and others going so far as to accuse Russia of genocide. The crime of genocide is difficult to prove, as prosecutors would have to show that the killers or their commanders had a “specific intent” to partially or wholly destroy a group of people — but the use of the word has clear emotional resonance and could serve to draw even more attention to the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the allegations, describing the scenes outside Kyiv as a “stage-managed anti-Russian provocation.” He said the mayor of Bucha made no mention of atrocities a day after Russian troops left last week, but two days later scores of bodies were photographed scattered in the streets. He said Russia is pushing for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the matter, but the U.K., which currently chairs the body, has refused to convene it. The United States and Britain have accused Russia in recent weeks of using Security Council meetings to spread disinformation. European leaders, meanwhile, left no doubt about who they thought was behind the killings. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said “the Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area.” “The perpetrators of war crimes and other serious violations as well as the responsible government officials and military leaders will be held accountable,” he added. French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that there is “clear evidence of war crimes” in Bucha that demand new measures. “I’m in favor of a new round of sanctions and in particular on coal and gasoline. We need to act,” he said on France-Inter radio. But Poland’s prime minister, who described Russia under President Vladimir Putin as a “totalitarian-fascist state,” lashed out at German and French leaders by name for not doing more, while calling for actions “that will finally break Putin’s war machine."" “President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin? What have you achieved? ... Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?” Mateusz Morawiecki asked. “Chancellor Scholz, Olaf, it is not the voices of German businesses that should be heard aloud in Berlin today. It is the voice of these innocent women and children."" He said “the bloody massacres perpetrated by Russian soldiers deserve to be called by name: This is genocide.” Spain's prime minister also used the word “genocide.” But election victories by incumbent right-wing parties that are friendly to Russia in both Hungary and Serbia over the weekend pointed to other potential cracks in Western opposition to the invasion. The U.S. and its allies have sought to punish Russia for the invasion by imposing sweeping economic sanctions. But they may be reluctant to impose measures that cause further harm to a global economy still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. As a major oil and gas exporter, Russia stands to benefit from any rise in already high global energy prices. Europe is in a particular bind, since it gets 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil from Russia. Governments have been scrambling to find ways to reduce that reliance without causing a substantial loss of economic output. Over the weekend, Lithuania announced it cut itself off entirely from gas imports from Russia. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, who is also the economy minister and responsible for energy, said Europe can go “significantly further” in imposing sanctions against Russia. But he said Germany is right to take a longer-term approach to abandoning Russian energy imports. Germany has faced criticism for opposing an immediate halt to Russian energy deliveries. The country says it hopes to end Russian coal imports this summer and oil imports by the end of the year, but halting gas will take longer since it relies more heavily on it. “We are working every day on creating the conditions for and steps toward an embargo,” Habeck said. ""We are on the right track.” Wolfgang Buechner, a German government spokesman, meanwhile, said Putin and his supporters “will feel the consequences” of additional measures to be approved in the coming days, though he provided no details. Putin’s Feb. 24 invasion has left thousands of people dead and forced more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee their country. Putin has said the attack is aimed at eliminating a security threat and demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join the NATO military alliance of Western countries. Ukraine insists it never posed any threat but has offered to officially declare itself neutral. While Western officials initially said they believed Putin's goal was to take Kyiv and potentially install a Kremlin-friendly government, Russian forces faced stiff resistance outside the capital and on other fronts, and have now retreated from some areas. Moscow says it is currently focusing its offensive on the Donbas in the country’s east, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for years. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia continued to flood soldiers and mercenaries from the Wagner private military group into the Donbas. It said Russian troops are still trying to take the region's strategic port city of Mariupol, which has seen weeks of heavy fighting and some of the worst suffering of the war. “Mariupol is almost certainly a key objective of the Russian invasion,"" the ministry said, as it would provide a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said its forces had retaken some towns in the northern Chernihiv region and humanitarian aid was being delivered. ——— Qena reported from Motyzhyn, Ukraine.

"As he prepares to continue his autocratic governance of Hungary for another four years, Viktor Orban faces a shattered opposition at home but an increasingly isolated position abroad On Location: April 4, 2022 BUDAPEST, Hungary -- As Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban prepares to continue his autocratic governance of Hungary for another four years, he faces a shattered opposition at home but an increasingly isolated position abroad, where his flouting of democratic standards and approach to the war in Ukraine has riled the European Union and other nations. On Sunday, as officials from his right-wing Fidesz party gathered at an election night event on the Danube river in Budapest, Orban told supporters that their landslide victory in the country's national election was a message to Europe that his model of “illiberal democracy"" was a prophecy for the continent's future. “The whole world has seen tonight in Budapest that Christian democratic politics, conservative civic politics and patriotic politics have won. We are telling Europe that this is not the past, this is the future, our common European future,” Orban said. But while Orban's party won 53% of the vote in Hungary, convincing Europe to get on board won't be so easy. Orban already faces heavy pressure in the EU to change tack on his approach to corruption, minority rights and media freedom, and as war rages in neighboring Ukraine, his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin have alienated even some of his closest allies. During Hungary's election campaign, a Western-looking coalition of opposition parties challenging Orban called for Hungary to support its embattled neighbor and act in lockstep with its EU and NATO partners. Yet Orban, considered to be Putin's closest ally in the EU, insisted that Hungary remain neutral and maintain its close economic ties with Moscow, including continuing to import Russian gas and oil on favorable terms. The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Saturday depicted the Hungarian leader as out of touch with the rest of Europe, which has united to condemn Putin, support sanctions against Russia and send aid including weapons to Ukraine. “He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr. Putin,” Zelenskyy said. Yet while speaking to supporters on Sunday, Orban singled out Zelenskyy as part of the “overwhelming force” that he said his party had struggled against in the election — “the left at home, the international left, the Brussels bureaucrats, the Soros empire with all its money, the international mainstream media, and in the end, even the Ukrainian president.” Orban's antagonistic approach to Zelenskyy and conspicuous caution around damaging relations with Russia, even as Moscow is accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine, has led to fault lines appearing among his European friends. Poland, also governed by a right-wing populist government, is Hungary's most loyal partner in the EU. But speaking to Polish public radio in the week before Hungary's vote, ruling party leader and Orban ally Jaroslaw Kaczynski said he was displeased with Orban’s stance on Russia. “We will see what will happen after the elections and then this assessment can be finally formulated. But we are not happy,"" Kaczynski said. Hungary's vote had been expected to be the closest since Orban took power in 2010, thanks to the country's six main opposition parties putting aside their ideological differences to form a united front against Fidesz. But with 99% of votes counted in the election for the country's 199-seat parliament, Fidesz held 53% of the vote while the opposition coalition, steeply underperforming expectations, had 35%. Edit Zgut, a political scientist at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, predicted that the clear victory for Orban would allow him to move further in an autocratic direction, sidelining dissidents and capturing new areas of the economy. “Hungary seems to have reached a point of no return,” she said. “The key lesson is that the playing field is tilted so much that it became almost impossible to replace Fidesz in elections.” Orban — a fierce critic of immigration, LGBTQ rights and “EU bureaucrats” — has garnered the admiration of right-wing nationalists across Europe and North America. Along with the parliamentary election, a referendum on LGBTQ issues was held on Sunday with questions pertaining to sex education programs in schools and the availability to children of information about sex reassignment. Participation failed to reach the 50% threshold to make it legally binding, with 20% of voters spoiling their ballots, part of an opposition initiative to sabotage the referendum which it decried as homophobic. Of the 44% of voters who cast valid votes, more than 92% voted with the government’s position In a surprise performance, radical right-wing party Our Homeland Movement appeared to have garnered more than 6% of the vote, exceeding the 5% threshold needed to gain seats in parliament. Opposition parties and international observers have noted structural impediments to defeating Orban, highlighting pervasive pro-government bias in the public media, the domination of commercial news outlets by Orban allies and a heavily gerrymandered electoral map. Speaking to supporters in Budapest late Sunday, opposition leader Peter Marki-Zay conceded defeat but argued that Fidesz had won under a system of its own making. “We knew in advance that it would be an extremely unequal fight,"" Marki-Zay said. ""We do not dispute that Fidesz won this election. That this election was democratic and free is, of course, something we continue to dispute.” ——— Associated Press writer Vanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed to this report.",4
"Ukraine's President Zelenskyy calls the killings genocide, but the U.S. won't. Biden on Putin: ‘This guy is brutal’ The killings of Ukrainian civilians committed by Russian forces in Ukraine is a war crime, President Joe Biden said Monday -- repeating his accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin in a ""war criminal"" who needs to be held ""accountable."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""genocide"" on Sunday after hundreds of Ukrainian civilians were found killed in Bucha, a suburb of the capital Kyiv that was retaken by Ukrainian forces. Some of the civilians were buried in mass graves, others found dead in the street with their hands tied behind their backs. The U.S. has stopped short of using the term ""genocide"" because of its strict legal definition and the heavy implications it carries. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening with Bucha is outrageous. And everyone’s seeing it,"" Biden said. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual -- have a war crimes trial,"" Biden told reporters Monday, but when asked if it were genocide, he said, ""No, I think it is a war crime."" Still, Biden's call for for a possible war crimes trial raises the pressure on the international community's response to Russia's war, which has killed thousands and displaced more than 10 million people. Biden said he would seek more sanctions against Putin and his government over the atrocities in Bucha, although it's unclear if more economic pressure will do anything to bring an end to Putin's campaign, which has shifted away from the Kyiv area to the south and east. This is a developing story. Please check back in for updates.",2
"President Joe Biden called for a war crimes trial against Russian President Vladimir Putin and said he’d seek more sanctions after reported atrocities in Ukraine Biden on Putin: ‘This guy is brutal’ WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial against Russia President Vladimir Putin and said he’d seek more sanctions after reported atrocities in Ukraine. “You saw what happened in Bucha,” Biden said. He added that Putin “is a war criminal.” Biden’s comments to reporters came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, one of the towns surrounding Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found. Zelenskyy called the Russian actions “genocide” and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia. Biden, however, stopped short of calling the actions genocide. The bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital. “We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual -- have a war crimes trial,” Biden said. Biden lashed out at Putin as “brutal.” ""What’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone sees it,” Biden added. White House officials said talks about ramping up new sanctions against Russia intensified after reports of alleged atrocities emerged. Biden said Monday that he would continue to add sanctions but did not detail what sectors the U.S. may target next. After unveiling an avalanche of sanctions in the first weeks of the war, administration officials in recent days have put more focus on closing loopholes that Russia might try to use to avoid sanctions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, tweeted Monday that he European Union will send investigators to Ukraine to help the local prosecutor general “document war crimes."" A Russian law enforcement agency says it has launched its own investigation into allegations that Ukrainian civilians were massacred in suburbs of Kyiv that were held by Russian troops, focusing on what it calls “false information” about Russian forces. The Investigative Committee claims Ukrainian authorities made the allegations “with the aim of discrediting Russian troops” and that those involved should be investigated over possible breaches of a new Russian law banning what the government deems to be false information about its forces. Biden noted that he faced push back last month when he described Putin as a war crimina l for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine after hospitals and maternity wards were bombed. In his remarks on Monday, Biden made clear that label still applied. “This guy is brutal and what’s happening to Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it,"" Biden said. Investigations into Putin’s actions had begun before the new allegations of atrocities outside Kyiv. The U.S. and more than 40 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, after the passage of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry. There is another probe by the International Criminal Court, an independent body based in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Biden's chief envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced Monday that the U.S. plans to seek a suspension of Russia from its seat on the U.N.’s top human rights body in the wake of more indications Russian forces may have committed war crimes in Ukraine. That would require a decision by the U.N. General Assembly. Russia and the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council – Britain, China, France and the United States – all currently have seats on the 47-member-state rights council, which is based in Geneva. The United States rejoined the council this year.",6
"Tesla CEO Elon Musk owns a 9% stake in Twitter and is now the social media platform's largest shareholder Tesla CEO Elon Musk acquired a 9% stake in Twitter to become its largest shareholder, just before raising questions about the social media platform’s dedication to free speech and the First Amendment. The ultimate aim of Musk's 73.5 million share purchase worth $3 billion based on the closing price Friday, is not clear. Yet in late March Musk, who has 80 million Twitter followers and is very active on the site, questioned free speech on Twitter and whether the platform is undermining democracy. According to Securities and Exchange filing Monday, Musk bought the shares on March 14, describing him as a long-term investor looking to minimize his buying and selling of the shares. That means that Musk acquired the shares before beginning his public discourse on the First Amendment and Twitter. Yet Musk has also raised the possibility, publicly before his massive and loyal Twitter following, that he could create a rival social media network. Industry analysts are skeptical about whether the mercurial CEO will remain on the sidelines for long. In a note to investors, CFRA Analyst Angelo Zino wrote that although Musk's intent is unclear, Twitter could be viewed as an acquisition target because its shares have been falling since early last year. The company, according to Zino, has failed to adequately monetize the platform during the past several years. Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO in November. “Musk's actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth, and an all-out buyout should not be ruled out,” wrote Zino, who covers Twitter and social media. Musk's stake in Twitter more than four times the size of Dorsey's, who co-founded the company and was the largest individual shareholder until Musk arrived. Twitter's stock surged more than 25% Monday. Since Musk bought his stake on March 14, shares of Twitter are up nearly 50%. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk told his millions of followers on Twitter that he was “ giving serious thought "" to creating his own social media platform and has clashed repeatedly with financial regulators about his use of Twitter. His Twitter stock purchase comes as Musk is locked into a bitter dispute with U.S. securities regulators over his ability to post on Twitter. Musk’s lawyer has contended in court motions that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is infringing on the Tesla CEO’s First Amendment rights. In October of 2018, Musk and Tesla agreed to pay $40 million in civil fines and for Musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The funding was far from secured and the electric vehicle company remains public, but Tesla’s stock price jumped. The settlement specified governance changes, including Musk’s ouster as board chairman, as well as pre-approval of his tweets. The SEC brought a securities fraud charge, alleging that Musk was manipulating the stock price with his posts. Musk’s lawyer is now asking a U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan to throw out the settlement, contending that the SEC is harassing him and infringing on his First Amendment rights. Early in March, Musk asked Judge Alison Nathan to nullify an SEC subpoena and throw out the settlement agreement. His lawyer, Alex Spiro, said the SEC has used the court agreement “to trample on Mr. Musk’s First Amendment rights and to impose prior restraints on his speech.” The SEC responded in a court motion, saying it has legal authority to subpoena Tesla and Musk about his tweets, and that Musk’s move to throw out the settlement is not valid. The SEC disclosed that it is investigating Musk’s Nov. 6, 2021 tweets that asked followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake. The commission confirmed that it issued administrative subpoenas while investigating whether Musk and Tesla are complying with disclosure controls in the 2018 agreement. Shortly after Musk's tweets about potentially selling off shares, he began to do just that, and he wrote on Twitter that the sale would go to pay tax obligations on stock options. Analysts estimate his tax obligation at $10 billion to $15 billion. But some of the money could have been used to buy the Twitter stake. So far he has sold more than 15 million shares worth roughly $16.4 billion. With some sales in late December, Musk is close to selling 10%. Regulators are also is investigating whether Tesla described accurately in public filings with the agency whether it complied with the controls. The commission maintains that the subpoenas were lawful, and that Musk isn’t following proper legal procedure to challenge them. SEC attorney Melissa Armstrong called Musk’s challenge “frivolous,” and pointed out that Musk and Tesla agreed to have his tweets pre-approved by other company officials. “Courts have long recognized that ‘congress has vested the SEC with broad authority to conduct investigations into possible violations of federal securities laws and to demand production of evidence relevant to such investigations,’” Armstrong wrote. The subpoenas, issued under seal, come from a formal order by the commission authorizing the investigation. They seek all written communications concerning the Nov. 6 tweets and whether they were shown to Tesla lawyers for pre-approval. Musk's revelation about his stake in Twitter shares comes two days after Tesla Inc. posted first-quarter delivery numbers. While the company delivered 310,000 vehicles in the period, the figure was slightly below expectations. ———— Krisher reported from Detroit.",3
"The committee is meeting Monday and a full Senate vote could come by week's end. ABC News Live Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's first nominee to the Supreme Court, is expected to pass a major milestone Monday on her way to expected Senate confirmation later this week. The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote Monday on whether to send Jackson's nomination to the full Senate, setting up a final confirmation vote possibly on Friday. While confirmation is nearly certain for Jackson, it's unclear how many Republicans will cross the aisle to vote for her. So far, only one, Maine's Sen. Susan Collins, has said she would vote for Jackson -- and Collins does not sit on the Judiciary Committee. Ranking Member Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced after the committee kicked off its business Monday morning that he will vote no on Jackson's nomination, paving the way for the 22-member, evenly-split committee to end in a tie vote. An 11-11 tie will force Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to file a discharge motion to bring the nomination before the full Senate in order to get it out of committee. That motion comes with four hours of floor debate, where some Republicans are expected to try to slow down the process. If Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Mitt Romney of Utah were to vote to advance Jackson's nomination out of committee on the full floor vote, it may signal how they will vote later in the week when the Senate formally considers Jackson's nomination to the high court. But even without Republican support, Democrats have the power to push her nomination forward. The final vote, while bipartisan, will likely be narrower than what the White House had hoped for. ""What I know is she will get enough votes to get confirmed,"" White House chief of staff Ron Klain told ABC's ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""In the end, I suppose, that's the only thing that matters. But I wish more Republicans would look at the case here, look at the record and vote to confirm Judge Jackson."" With a two-week Easter in sight for senators, Democrats are hoping for a final vote before the weekend. If confirmed, Jackson would be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court.

"Jamie Dimon laid out a laundry list of big risks looming for the global and U.S. economy in his annual letter to JPMorgan Chase shareholders on Monday US will feel impacts of war in grocery store: Donna Brazile NEW YORK -- Jamie Dimon laid out a laundry list of big risks looming for the global and U.S. economy in his letter to JPMorgan Chase shareholders on Monday, Dimon’s annual letter has become something of a tradition for JPMorgan investors as well as the public. Never too shy to share his thoughts on anything, the CEO and chairman of JPMorgan often uses his shareholder letter to not only discuss ongoing challenges for the bank but also political or social issues that he feels need to be addressed. “We are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly polarized U.S. election, mounting inflation, a war in Ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against Russia,"" he wrote. The letter is a contrast to last year’s version, when vaccines were rolling out nationwide and it appeared like the U.S. economy was accelerating out of the pandemic-caused economic turmoil. Dimon spent much of the latest letter discussing the issue of inflation, which has accelerated sharply in the past year and is now at four-decade highs. He warned that the war in Ukraine could accelerate inflation due to higher food and energy costs. He also put some blame on the Federal Reserve, which now faces a need to increase interest rates sharply this year to combat inflation. “The Federal Reserve and the government did the right thing by taking bold dramatic actions following the misfortune unleashed by the pandemic. In hindsight, it worked. But also in hindsight, the medicine … was probably too much and lasted too long.” “I do not envy the Fed for what it must do next: The stronger the recovery, the higher the rates that follow,” he added. Dimon, who has long advocated for the U.S. to rebuild its infrastructure and put money into energy independence by developing oil and gas assets domestically, said the war in Ukraine should be seen as yet another reason why being reliant on foreign sources of oil is not good for the U.S. and its allies. “Disruptions to the global energy system are again highlighting our urgent global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably and, at the same time, address long-term clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce our carbon footprint,"" he said. JPMorgan will report its quarterly results next week, the start of earnings season for most of corporate America. Investors will be looking for banks to discuss the impact of the war as well as any bank exposure to Russia and Ukraine.",6
"The U.S. government has seized a 254-foot yacht in Spain owned by an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin President Zelenskyy calls Russia’s actions ‘genocide’ PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain -- The U.S. government on Monday seized a 254-foot yacht in Spain owned by an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a first by the Biden administration under sanctions imposed after the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine and targeting pricey assets of Russian elites. Spain's Civil Guard and U.S. federal agents descended on the Tango at the Marina Real in the port of Palma de Mallorca, the capital of Spain’s Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. Associated Press reporters at the scene saw police going in and out of the boat. The U.S. Justice Department, which obtained a warrant from a federal judge in Washington, alleges the yacht should be forfeited for violating U.S. bank fraud, money laundering and sanctions statutes. Superyachtfan.com, a specialized website that tracks the world’s largest and most exclusive recreational boats, values the 78-meter vessel, which carries the Cook Islands flag, at $120 million. The yacht is among the assets linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close Putin ally who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate encompassing metals, mining, tech and other assets, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. All of Vekselberg’s assets in the United States are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Prosecutors allege Vekselberg bought the Tango in 2011 and has owned it since then, though they believe he has used shell companies to try to obfuscate his ownership and to avoid financial oversight. They contend Vekselberg and those working for him continued to make payments using U.S. banks to support and maintain the yacht, even after sanctions were imposed on him in 2018. Those payments included a stay in December 2020 at a luxury water villa resort in the Maldives and fees to moor the yacht. It's the first U.S. seizure of an oligarch’s yacht since U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen assembled a task force known as REPO — short for Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs — as an effort to enforce sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. ""It will not be the last.” Garland said in a statement. “Together, with our international partners, we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war.” Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. He was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and has worked closely with his American cousin, Andrew Intrater, who heads the New York investment management firm Columbus Nova. Vekselberg and Intrater were thrust into the spotlight in that investigation after the lawyer for adult film star Stormy Daniels released a memo that claimed $500,000 in hush money was routed through Columbus Nova to a shell company set up by Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Columbus Nova denied that Vekselberg played any role in its payments to Cohen. Vekselberg and Intrater met with Cohen at Trump Tower, one of several meetings between members of Trump's inner circle and high-level Russians during Trump's 2016 campaign and the transition before his presidency. The 64-year-old Vekselberg founded Renova Group more than three decades ago. The group holds the largest stake in United Co. Rusal, Russia’s biggest aluminum producer, among other investments. Vekselberg was first sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018, and again in March of this year, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began. Vekselberg has also been sanctioned by authorities in the United Kingdom. The yacht sails under the Cook Islands flag and is owned by a company registered in the British Virgin Islands administered by different societies in Panama, the Civil Guard said, “following a complicated financial and societal web to conceal its truthful ownership.” Agents confiscated documents and computers inside the yacht that will be analyzed to confirm he real identity of the owner, it said. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a sanctions enforcement task force known as KleptoCapture, which also aims to enforce financial restrictions in the U.S. imposed on Russia and its billionaires, working with the FBI, the U.S. Treasury and other federal agencies. That task force will also target financial institutions and entities that have helped oligarchs move money to dodge sanctions. The White House has said that many allied countries, including German, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and others are involved in trying to collect and share information against Russians targeted for sanctions. In his State of the Union address on March 1, President Joe Biden warned oligarchs that the U.S. and European allies would “find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets.” “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” he said. Monday's capture is not the first time Spanish authorities have been involved in the seizure of a Russian oligarch’s superyacht. Officials said they had seized a vessel valued at over $140 million owned by the CEO of a state-owned defense conglomerate and a close Putin ally. French authorities have seized superyachts, including one believed to belong to Igor Sechin, a Putin ally who runs Russian oil giant Rosneft, which has been on the U.S. sanctions list since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Italy has seized several yachts and other assets. Italian financial police moved quickly seizing the superyacht Lena belonging to Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch close to Putin, in the port of San Remo; the 65-meter (215-foot) Lady M owned by Alexei Mordashov in nearby Imperia, featuring six suites and estimated to be worth 65 million euros; as well as villas in Tuscany and Como, according to government officials. ——— Parra reported from Madrid and Balsamo reported from Washington.",3
"The Pentagon wants Russian actions in Bucha to be investigated as war crimes. Outrage mounts as images from Ukraine show apparent evidence of war crimes The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 40: Nearly 70% of Russian troops near Kyiv have withdrawn About two-thirds of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv have withdrawn toward Belarus, according to the official. This up from an estimated 20% late last week. Before repositioning, there were close to 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) bearing down on Kyiv from the north and northwest, with each group comprised of 700-900 troops. Roughly 13 of those BTGs are now either in Belarus or on their way there, the official said. The Pentagon believes these forces will be resupplied and possibly reenforced in the north before heading back into Ukraine to fight elsewhere. ""Our best assessment -- and it is only an assessment -- is that they will be applied in the eastern part of the country in the Donbas region,"" the official said. The U.S. has also seen some Russian troops leave the Ukrainian city of Sumy to head north to the Russian border, according to the official. Despite these movements, the official said the ""vast majority"" of the more than 125 BTGs that Russia committed to the invasion are still inside Ukraine. 'Sickening' Russian atrocities in Bucha The official said that while the U.S. cannot independently verify Ukrainian claims of Russian atrocities committed against civilians in Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv recently retaken by Ukrainian troops, there is no reason to doubt them. ""It's sickening, it's disgusting,"" the official said, adding that the claims should be included in the growing list of alleged Russian war crimes to be investigated. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the town, where he accused Russia of genocide. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were found dead there, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range. ""We have long said that the Russians would be brutal in their execution of this war. They have been,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. ""We said more than a week ago that we clearly believe the evidence pointed to war crimes by Russian forces. And what we're seeing out of Bucha certainly reinforces those concerns."" President Joe Biden put blame on Russian president Vladimir Putin while speaking to reporters Monday. ""You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal,"" Biden said. ""Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha ... he is a war criminal."" Russia shifting airstrikes In addition to moving some of its troops away from the capital, Russia has also refocused its long-range strikes elsewhere, largely in the eastern and southern parts of the country, the official said. ""Clearly they're still hitting Mariupol, but we have not seen the same level of airstrike activity on Kyiv,"" the official said. ""So there's been a declination there over the last few days."" Russia has fired more than 1,400 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. Military aid being rushed into Ukraine The U.S. has continued to rush small arms, anti-tank and aircraft missiles and medical supplies into Ukraine, and has coordinating shipments from a half dozen other donor nations in the last 24 hours, according to the senior defense official. ""Everything we're doing with respect to Ukraine is being expedited -- everything,"" the official said.",1
"Dandre Martin, 26, was arrested on illegal firearm possession charges. 6 dead, at least 12 wounded in Sacramento mass shooting Sacramento police have arrested a suspected gunman in the shooting that killed six people in a popular nightlife area over the weekend. Dandre Martin, 26, was identified as a ""related suspect"" in the shooting, which broke out on K Street in downtown Sacramento early Sunday morning just after a fight took place, the Sacramento Police Department said. Martin was arrested on assault and illegal firearm possession charges, police said. More than 100 shell casings were recovered from the scene, according to police. Investigators believe multiple gunmen are responsible for the shooting and are sifting through hundreds of pieces of evidence, Sacramento Police Chief Kathy Lester said during a press conference Sunday afternoon. Video posted on Twitter on Sunday showed people running through the street as the apparent sound of rapid gunfire could be heard in the background. The victims were identified by the Sacramento County Coroner’s office on Monday as Johntaya Alexander, 21; Melinda Davis, 57; Sergio Harris, 38; Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21; and Devazia Turner, 29. At least a dozen people were injured in the shooting, Lester said. The conditions of the injured victims were not immediately known, police said. It is not known whether the alleged gunmen knew each other, Lester said. A large crowd was present at the time of the shooting, she added. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg condemned the shooting during a news conference Sunday afternoon, describing it as ""a senseless and unacceptable tragedy."" ""And I emphasize the word unacceptable,"" Steinberg said. ""Thoughts and prayers are not nearly enough. We must do more as a city as a state and as a nation.

"Former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin picked up a prized endorsement from former President Donald Trump in her bid to fill the remainder of the late U.S. Rep. Don Young’s term On Location: April 4, 2022 ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin picked up a prized endorsement from former President Donald Trump in her bid to fill the remainder of the late U.S. Rep. Don Young’s term. Trump backed Palin late Sunday in a statement from his political action committee. “Wonderful patriot Sarah Palin just announced that she is running for Congress, and that means there will be a true America First fighter on the ballot,” the statement says. A total of 51 candidates signed up by the Friday deadline to run in a special primary following Young's death on March 18 at age 88. The top four vote getters will advance to an Aug. 16 special election, in which ranked choice voting will be used. The winner will serve until January, when the current term ends. Some of candidates who filed for the special primary — including Palin — have also filed to seek a regular two-term House term starting in January. Candidates had until noon Monday to remove their names from consideration. Three candidates withdrew by the deadline, leaving the field at 48 candidates, Alaska Division of Elections spokesperson Tiffany Montemayor said in an email. Other candidates with name recognition include Nick Begich, grandson of former Rep. Nick Begich, who died in office and held Alaska’s sole seat in the House before Young was elected in 1973; a North Pole City Council member who legally changed his name to Santa Claus; former lawmakers John Coghill and Andrew Halcro; Anchorage Assembly member Christopher Constant; former U.S. Senate candidate Al Gross; Emil Notti, an Alaska Native leader who narrowly lost to Young in the 1973 election, and Josh Revak and Tara Sweeney, who were co-chairs of Young’s reelection campaign. This is the third time Trump has issued an endorsement in Alaska races. Earlier he backed Kelly Tshibaka, a former state official, in her bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Trump has vowed revenge against Murkowski, a Republican, after she voted to convict him in his impeachment trial and also called on him to resign after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Tshibaka has trailed Murkowski in campaign funds. Murkowski ended 2021 with $4.3 million cash on hand, while Tshibaka reported just over $600,000. Campaign finance reports are due soon for the first quarter of 2022. Tshibaka’s report will cover a Feb. 10 fundraiser hosted with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The other endorsement Trump gave was to Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, but that was conditional. Trump said Dunleavy would receive his blessing if Dunleavy didn’t endorse Murkowski, a condition and endorsement Dunleavy accepted. Palin endorsed Trump early in 2016 before he won the presidency that year. “Now, it’s my turn,” he said, calling her a champion of Alaska values, energy jobs and its people. Palin in 2008 was selected by then-Sen. John McCain to be his running mate against then-Sen. Barack Obama. Trump said she “lifted the McCain presidential campaign out of the dumps"" — even though they were ultimately defeated by Obama. Trump said he was “proud to give her my complete and total endorsement.” Palin thanked Trump on Twitter, saying she was “honored to have your support.” The June 11 special primary will be conducted primarily by mail, a statewide first, with state election officials citing the tight timeline to hold the event as a major factor. The Aug. 16 special election will coincide with the regular primary. Voters in 2020 approved a new elections system that ends party primaries and institutes ranked voting for general elections. Those processes will be used for the first time in Alaska this year. Elections officials are targeting Sept. 2 to certify the winner of the special election. The regular primary and November general election will determine who represents Alaska in the House for a two-year term starting in January.",0
"The task force tracks down the assets of oligarchs trying to evade sanctions. Russian oligarch and Chelsea owner squeezed by sanctions A yacht that belongs to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg has been seized in Marina Real in the Spanish port of Palma de Mallorca, according to court documents unsealed Monday. The yacht was seized on Monday by Spanish authorities and KleptoCapture, the Justice Department task force charged with finding the assets of oligarchs trying to evade sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We will now seek to have the vessel forfeited as the proceeds of a crime,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a video message released Monday by the Justice Department. A spokesperson for Vekselberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News. Vekselberg was designated an oligarch by U.S. authorities in 2018, when he was sanctioned by the United Sates following Russia's invasion of Crimea. Court documents say Vekselberg was subject to more sanctions once Russia invaded Ukraine.  In addition to the seizure of Vekselberg's yacht, U.S. authorities also obtained seizure warrants unsealed in Washington, D.C., Monday that target roughly $625,000 associated with sanctioned parties that's being held at nine U.S. financial institutions, the Justice Department said. The KleptoCapture task force is trying to find yachts, airplanes and other moveable property before it can be moved into jurisdictions where it might be more difficult for U.S. authorities to investigate. ""The point of going after Putin's cronies and Russian oligarchs who seek to violate our laws and shield their assets is to say that nobody is beyond the reach of our system of justice, beyond the reach of our work and cooperation with our allies,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told ABC News' Byron Pitts last month. ""And that these cronies and oligarchs who seek to support and bolster the Russian regime shouldn't be able to get away with that while people are dying,""",6
"The United States plans to seek a suspension of Russia from its seat on the U.N.’s top human rights body amid increasing signs that Russian troops may have committed war crimes in Ukraine BUCHAREST, Romania -- The United States plans to seek a vote this week to suspend Russia from its seat on the U.N.’s top human rights body, pointing to increasing signs that Russian troops may have committed war crimes in Ukraine, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Monday. Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the Human Rights Council in the wake of reports over the weekend about violence against civilians in the town of Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after Russian forces pulled out. The reports have sparked a wave of outrage and condemnation against Russia. “We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said at a news conference in Romania’s capital, Bucharest. She called Russia’s participation on the rights council a “farce” that “hurts the credibility of the council and the U.N. writ large” and is “simply wrong."" Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke Monday with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres about events in Bucha and tweeted: “No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council.” “Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account,” Kuleba said. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly in New York has the final say, and any resolution to strip Russia of its membership rights would require support from two-thirds of member countries that vote. Thomas-Greenfield told NPR the U.S. plans to seek a vote “as soon as possible this week, and possibly as early as Thursday.” She said her message was simple to the 140 assembly members who voted last month to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: “The images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us now to match our words with action."" “We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council,” she said. The 47-member council is the U.N.’s premier human rights body, and the General Assembly decies which states hold the seats. Russia and the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, and the United States — all currently have seats on the rights council, which the U.S. rejoined this year. In New York, General Assembly spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said Monday that no request for a meeting on the issue had yet been received. Russia’s ambassador in Geneva shot back by calling the U.S. statement “(b)aseless, unfounded and purely emotional bravado that looks good on camera -- just how the US likes it.” “Washington exploits the Ukrainian crisis for its own benefit in an attempt either to exclude or suspend Russia from international organizations, including the HRC here in Geneva,” Gennady Gatilov said, in comments relayed by a Russian diplomatic mission spokesman. The only country to have its membership rights stripped at the council was Libya in 2011, when upheaval in the North African country brought down longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi, said council spokesman Rolando Gomez. The council started work in 2006. No permanent member of the security council has ever had its membership revoked from any U.N. body. Referring to the General Assembly, Gatilov said the U.S. effort “is unlikely to be supported by the majority of its member states.” Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv that have been recaptured from Russian forces in recent days. Thomas-Greenfield said she would go to the Security Council on Tuesday on her return to New York to “address Russia’s actions firmly and directly.” She mentioned the U.S. plan during a bilateral meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca, whose government she praised for its “extraordinary effort” in receiving hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine. More than 600,000 refugees have fled to safety in Romania since Russia launched its invasion. Thomas-Greenfield also visited the Romanian capital’s main train station, where she met with humanitarian workers helping to receive refugees. Her visit to Romania came a day after she met with leaders in Chisinau, Moldova’s capital, where she announced that the U.S. will provide $50 million (45 million euros) “to help the Government of Moldova and its people cope with the impacts of Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war.” Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of around 2.6 million, has so far received around 400,000 refugees from war-torn Ukraine. The $50 million assistance is in addition to more than $30 million the U.S. has provided Moldova for its humanitarian efforts during the crisis. ——— Keaten reported from Geneva.

"“As a result, 200,000 uninsured people are expected to gain coverage."" Obama makes 1st White House visit since leaving office President Joe Biden on Tuesday will announce new steps his administration is taking to build on the Affordable Care Act, including a new executive order and a proposed rule from the Treasury Department to fix the ACA's so-called ""family glitch."" ""Under Treasury's new proposed rule, family members who have to pay more than 10% of income for coverage can be able to receive financial help under the ACA,"" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters Monday night. ""As a result, 200,000 uninsured people are expected to gain coverage and nearly a million more are expected to see lower premiums every day."" The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that more than 5.1 million people fall in the ACA family glitch, but senior administration officials said they don't believe everyone will choose to leave their current coverage plans, which is why they gave the above estimate of 200,000 newly insured and roughly 1 million switching plans. The rule would begin to take effect beginning Jan. 1, 2023, if enacted, and Americans will be able to sign up to get financial assistance during the next open enrollment period. Paraphrasing Biden's memorable ""this is a big f***** deal"" quote on the day then-President Barack Obama signed the ACA, senior administration officials said, ""to borrow a phrase, this rule is a - is a big deal."" ""We think it's the most significant administrative action to improve implementation of the ACA that we've taken since the law was first implemented."" The executive order Biden will sign will highlight ways to make it easier for people to enroll in and keep their coverage, helping people better understand their coverage options, strengthen and improve benefits, and improve access to health care providers. It will also take steps to reduce medical debt, officials said. Biden will highlight these steps during a Tuesday afternoon event in the Rose Garden alongside Obama.",6
"Memories of 2010 continue to haunt Democrats. Obama returning to White House The TAKE with Rick Klein Former President Barack Obama will be at the White House on Tuesday for the first time since he left the presidency. That's a ""big f-ing deal,"" to get the inevitable joke out of the way. So is the 12th anniversary of the signing into law of the Affordable Care Act, perhaps the signature policy accomplishment of the Obama years and the occasion being celebrated by Obama and President Joe Biden. But memories of Obama don't need all that much of a refresh - and not just because the Kansas Jayhawks cut down the championship nets for the first time since 2008, which Obama on Monday night recalled as a “pretty good year.” To that last point, memories of 2010 continue to haunt Democrats. Republicans famously netted 63 House seats that November in Obama's first midterms; for comparison's sake, Obama's approval rating was in the high 40s in April of that year, while Biden's is in the low 40s now. Conversations now about how to stem losses often turn to discussions of how Democrats failed to sell Obamacare to a skeptical public, as voters' anger grew. For all that, the fact that there's even a 12th anniversary to celebrate -- after all the GOP promises to repeal it -- is an achievement in and of itself. Tuesday's visit is being cast as a one-off event, rather than the launch of any new initiative involving the former president. But Democrats also know that the push to engage their voters again revolves around the ability to get the Obama-Biden coalition back and ready to cast ballots. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper An almost certain path has been cleared for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation to the Supreme Court, despite every Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing her nomination. When the Senate comes to a full vote on Jackson, three Republicans plan to join Democrats in voting for her confirmation. Sens. Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski announced their intentions Monday. Sen. Susan Collins said last week that Jackson had her support. Democrats didn't need a single Republican vote for a successful confirmation, but now the Biden administration will be able to tout bipartisan support. Monday's announcements came after the Senate Judiciary Committee came down to a tied party-line vote on advancing Jackson's nomination. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took extra procedural steps Monday to force the nomination's move to the full chamber, and a full Senate vote is expected later this week. In committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican member, announced his opposition to Jackson, citing what he described as the judge's ""reinterpretation"" of law. Other GOP lawmakers rehashed the same arguments employed during Jackson's March confirmation hearings. Some pointed to her judicial philosophy, and some enlisted the misleading talking points about her sentencing in child pornography cases to justify their ""no"" votes. Predictably, lawmakers who may run for president in 2024 leveled the harshest attacks of the day. Sen. Tom Cotton called Jackson a ""far left activist"" and a judge who would ""coddle criminals and terrorists."" Sen. Ted Cruz, who was Jackson's law school classmate, said she would be the ""most extreme and the furthest left justice ever to serve on the United States Supreme Court,"" which contradicts statements from the American Bar Association on Jackson and by conservative jurists who support her. The latest Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans disapprove of the way Republicans have handled Jackson's confirmation process. Jackson's confirmation process is still on track for completion before the Senate breaks for Easter recess, which means she could make history as the first Black woman to ascend to the nation's highest court by week's end. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema  Early voting and mail voting in Ohio begins Tuesday with the aftershocks of this year's redistricting process still playing out in the background. Voters will be able to cast their ballots in primary races for the open U.S. Senate seat and governor's office, as well as the federal congressional races which will be conducted according to a new map that was approved last month. But three categories of races -- contests for state House and Senate, as well as state central committees -- will not be on the ballot because the boundaries for those districts have not yet been settled. On Friday, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose officially announced the change, which means those elections will now take place later in the year, likely in early August. As reported by the Ohio Capital Journal, LaRose said he wouldn't be opposed to the impeachment of Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor by the legislature over her rulings that rejected GOP-backed redistricting maps. O'Connor's current term ends in December. The fallout is taking place despite the state adopting a new redistricting process that was supposed to do away with partisan gerrymandering. But after the redistricting commission missed two deadlines to pass new maps, the state's Republican-controlled legislature took the reins, which led to legal entanglements. The ongoing situation resulted in Gov. Mike DeWine recently suggesting that ""competitiveness"" be added as a requirement for future redistricting. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight  20.  That's the number of state-legislative chambers we expect to be competitive in 2022 out of the nation's 99 chambers. FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich, Aaron Bycoffe and Ryan Best analyzed dozens of new maps following the redistricting process, and they found that there are very few state-legislative chambers that will be competitive this decade. Even many battleground states, like Georgia, Florida and Wisconsin, which are competitive in statewide races, aren't competitive at the state-legislative level.

"The top U.S. military officer says the United States should look at the development of more bases in Eastern Europe to protect against Russian aggression New sanctions on Russia coming this week  WASHINGTON -- The United States should look at the development of more bases in Eastern Europe to protect against Russian aggression, but rotate forces through them rather than make permanent deployments, the top U.S military officer told Congress on Tuesday. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the basing could be funded by other countries such as Poland and the Baltics that want more U.S. troops. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said any effort to expand security in Eastern Europe is a “work in progress” that probably will be discussed at the NATO summit in June. Milley and Austin were testifying before the House Armed Services Committee on the 2023 budget proposal, but much of the focus of the hearing was the Russian war against Ukraine and what the U.S. can do to better help Ukraine and strengthen security across Europe. Milley was asked about the need to reallocate forces to Europe's eastern flank, where NATO allies are worried that they may be Russia's next target. “My advice would be to create permanent bases but don’t permanently station (forces), so you get the effect of permanence by rotational forces cycling through permanent bases,” he said. “I believe that a lot of our European allies, especially those such as the Baltics or Poland and Romania, and elsewhere — they’re very, very willing to establish permanent bases. They’ll build them, they’ll pay for them.” Austin added that he recently visited and spoke with leaders in the Baltics, noting that they made it clear they value U.S. troops there. “We'll continue to work with NATO to assess what the requirements will be moving forward,” Austin said. “We will be part of that solution.” The Pentagon is continuing to review its troop numbers across Europe, and whether to add more or shift some of those already there to other locations. Milley said Tuesday that while there are no decisions yet, there's a possibility, if not a probability"" of increase U.S. troops in Europe, and that need could be filled by rotational forces. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced last month that NATO is creating four new battlegroups, which usually number between 1,000 troops and 1,500 troops, to send to Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. NATO allies are set to discuss additional security measures at the upcoming summit. Milley has advocated using rotational forces more around the globe to defray the costs of permanently stationing troops and their families in allied countries at risk of war, such as South Korea and in the Persian Gulf. He said using this would eliminate some of the costs associated with schools, housing and other such services. Rotational forces deploy for shorter periods of time. Permanent forces are often deployed for two years to three years. Milley also agreed that Moscow's aggression in Ukraine, and its ongoing demands that the U.S. and NATO reduce troops and arms in European countries along Russia's borders, signal a lengthy conflict in the region that extends beyond Ukraine. “I do think this is a very protracted conflict and I think it’s at least measured in years. I don’t know about decades, but at least years for sure,"" said Milley. ""I think that NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners that are supporting Ukraine are going to be involved in this for quite some time.” Austin added that the broad Russian demands were not acceptable to NATO, and the U.S. is looking at ways to provide additional aid and training to countries, including non-NATO allies such as Georgia and Finland. Members of Congress pressed Austin and Milley on what could have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine, and that sanctions did not work as a deterrent. Both said that the only possible way to deter Russian may have been to put U.S. troops on the ground inside Ukraine, but that option was rejected because it risked a broader U.S. war with Russia. Milley said he isn’t sure Russian President Vladimir Putin was deterrable since invading Ukraine has been a long-term goal for Moscow. Milley and Austin also told the committee that the U.S. has learned a number of things as it has watched Russia struggle to fight against an unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian defense over the past month. They said Russia has significant military capabilities but has been unable to use them effectively. Austin said Russian forces lack training among their noncommissioned officers and the Kremlin has been unable to get the supplies and logistics needed to ground troops Austin said Ukraine has used Stinger and Javelin missiles effectively against Russian troops and weapons. Milley said that Ukraine’s junior officers, many trained by the U.S., have shown initiative and good command and control abilities.",7
"U.S. stocks fell in afternoon trading Tuesday as investors monitor the latest developments around Russia’s war in Ukraine and prepare for the next round of corporate earnings reports NEW YORK -- Stocks fell in afternoon trading Tuesday and bond yields jumped as investors monitor the latest developments around Russia’s war against Ukraine and prepare for the next round of corporate earnings reports. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% as of 1:38 p.m. Eastern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 70 points, or 0.2%, to 34,852 and the Nasdaq fell 1.8%. Weakness from big technology stocks weighed down the broader market. Companies in the sector, with their pricey valuations, tend to push the market higher or lower more forcefully. Chipmaker Qualcomm fell 4.6%. Twitter rose another 4.2% after disclosing an arrangement with Tesla chief Elon Musk that will give him a board seat but also limit how much of the company he can buy while he’s a director. The company disclosed a day earlier that the mercurial billionaire and Twitter critic had become the company’s largest shareholder. Treasury yields jumped again as investors brace for more aggressive moves by the Federal Reserve to rein in the hottest inflation in 40 years. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in a speech that it’s “of paramount importance” and that the central bank is set to keep raising short-term interest rates following its March hike, which was its first increase since 2018. Traders are pricing in a nearly 78% probability the Fed will raise its key overnight rate by half a percentage point at its next meeting in May. That’s double the usual amount and something the Fed hasn’t done since 2000. That helped the yield on the two-year Treasury jump to 2.51% from 2.46%, its highest level since March 2019. Brainard said the Fed would also soon throw into reverse the massive bond-buying program it engineered through the pandemic to keep longer-term rates low. She said the Fed could decide to roll some bonds off its balance sheet as soon as its May meeting, and “at a rapid pace.” That helped the 10-year Treasury yield jump to 2.56% from 2.46% before Brainard's speech, its highest level since April 2019. Higher interest rates tend to most hurt stocks that are seen as the priciest, which puts the focus on big technology and other high-growth stocks. Apple and Tesla were some of the biggest weights on the market. Wall Street is watching closely for any clues as to how sharply interest rates will rise as inflation persists. More details will be gleaned Wednesday when the Fed releases minutes from its March interest rate meeting. Russia's war in Ukraine remains a key focus for Wall Street as the potential for stricter economic sanctions increase. The European Union’s executive branch has proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia in what would be the first sanctions targeting the country’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine. The Treasury Department will not allow any Russian government debt payments from accounts at U.S. financial institutions to be made in U.S. dollars, restricting one of the strategies President Vladimir Putin is employing to stave off default. The stricter sanctions follow mounting evidence Russian soldiers deliberately killed civilians during the conflict. Wall Street is preparing for the next round of corporate earnings reports in the coming weeks. The results could give a clearer picture of how companies are dealing with the impact from rising inflation. Carnival rose 3.8% after the cruise line gave investors an encouraging bookings update. Norwegian Cruise Line rose 2.5% and Royal Caribbean rose 1.1%. Health care and consumer goods companies made solid gains. Insurer UnitedHealth Group rose 2.8% and Procter & Gamble rose 1.1%.",6
"The Treasury Department will not allow any Russian government debt payments from accounts at U.S. financial institutions to be made in U.S. dollars, an agency official says Global outrage grows over alleged war crimes in Ukraine WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department is moving to keep the Russian government from making debt payments at U.S. banks with U.S. dollars, restricting one of the strategies President Vladimir Putin is using to stave off default, an agency official said Tuesday. Russia faces several April deadlines to make debt payments. The Kremlin must now choose between draining its remaining valuable dollar reserves, using new revenue coming in or default, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to speak on the record. The Treasury decision comes after the agency previously said sanctions levied on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine still permit Russia to continue to make debt payments. The debt is owed to foreign investors, among others, and comes from government investments to presumably spur economic growth in Russia. Russia is currently facing skyrocketing inflation, shortages in essential goods and disrupted trade with the rest of the world as it continues its invasion of Ukraine. While the ruble has bounced back from the fall it took after the U.S. and European allies moved to bury the Russian economy, Putin has resorted to extreme financial measures to blunt the West’s penalties and inflate his currency. Western sanctions from the war have placed severe restrictions on banks and their financial transactions with Russia, and also have frozen much of the government’s reserves of foreign currency. The West has cut key Russian banks out of a financial messaging system known as SWIFT, which is used every day to route billions of dollars among more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world. Sanctions have been issued on Russian leadership, oligarchs, trade and natural resources, and the country's central bank. The U.S., EU and United Kingdom have limited the ability of Russia’s central bank to draw on more than $600 billion in foreign currency reserves and have frozen its gold reserves. That has left the central bank with few tools to prop up the ruble and prevent it from crumbling in value. The decision to limit bond payments will further deplete the resources Putin is using to continue his war against Ukraine and will cause more uncertainty and challenges for Russia's financial system, the Treasury official said. Darshak Dholakia, a trade and government regulations attorney in Washington, said now that Treasury has restricted access to these funds, “it seems like the calculus has changed."" He said the U.S. is finding ways to ensure that Russia has less money to buy weapons by reducing its access to funds to pay for its bond obligations. “The U.S. has not put full blocking measures on the central bank yet,” he said. “They're saying that Russia can't touch those funds unless it's for an authorized purpose.” Once a country defaults, it can be cut off from bond-market borrowing until the default is sorted out and investors regain confidence in the government’s ability and willingness to pay. Additionally, holders of the bonds could take serious losses and can sue. Russia’s government can still borrow rubles at home, where it mostly relies on Russian banks to buy its bonds.",3
"The Biden administration plans to freeze federal student loan payments through Aug. 31, extending a moratorium that has allowed millions of Americans to postpone payments during the coronavirus pandemic WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration plans to freeze federal student loan payments through Aug. 31, extending a moratorium that has allowed millions of Americans to postpone payments during the coronavirus pandemic, according to an administration official familiar with the White House's decision-making. Student loan payments were scheduled to resume May 1 after being halted since early in the pandemic. But following calls from Democrats in Congress, the White House plans to give borrowers additional time to prepare for payments. The action applies to more than 43 million Americans who owe a combined $1.6 trillion in student debt held by the federal government, according to the latest data from the Education Department. That includes more than 7 million borrowers who have defaulted on student loans, meaning they are at least 270 days late on payments. Borrowers will not be asked to make payments until after Aug. 31, and interest rates are expected to remain at 0% during that period. The extension was first reported Tuesday by Bloomberg. Democrats on education panels in the House and Senate recently urged President Joe Biden to extend the moratorium through the end of the year, citing continued economic upheaval. Sen. Patty Murray said more time is needed to help Americans prepare for repayment and to rethink the government’s existing system for repaying student debt. “It is ruining lives and holding people back,” she said in a statement last month. “Borrowers are struggling with rising costs, struggling to get their feet back under them after public health and economic crises, and struggling with a broken student loan system — and all this is felt especially hard by borrowers of color.” Murray called on the Biden administration to lift all borrowers out of default to provide a “fresh start” following the pandemic. The decision is being made amid rising concern that large numbers of Americans would quickly fall behind if payments restarted in May. In March, the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank warned that resuming loan payments could place a heavy burden on borrowers who faced financial hardship during the pandemic. It said the impact would be hardest on Black families, who are more likely to rely on student loans to pay for college. “Serious delinquency rates for student debt could snap back from historic lows to their previous highs in which 10% or more of the debt was past due,” the bank said. The Trump administration initially gave Americans the option to suspend loan payments in March 2020, and Congress made it automatic soon after. The pause was extended twice by the Trump administration and twice more under Biden. It remains in question whether Biden will pursue widespread debt forgiveness to reduce the nation’s student debt. Some Democrats in Congress have pressed Biden to use executive action to cancel $50,000 for all student loan borrowers, saying it would jumpstart the economy and help Black Americans who on average face higher levels of student debt. Last year, Biden asked the Education and Justice departments to review the legality of widespread debt cancellation, but no decision has been announced. Biden previously said he supports canceling up to $10,000, but he argued it should be done through congressional action. ——— Binkley reported from Boston.",3
"His passionate speech was an indictment of the U.N. system itself. Zelenskyy addresses UN Security Council  In an impassioned address to the United Nations Security Council Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid down the gauntlet -- urging the U.N.'s most powerful body to either act or ""dissolve yourself altogether."" It was a challenge to the world's diplomats sitting in the historic chamber in New York, where any action to even condemn Russia's invasion has been blocked by Russia's veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. But it was also a searing indictment of the U.N. system itself, created in the ashes of World War II to ensure international peace and security. U.N. aid agencies are on the ground providing assistance, its human rights chief is monitoring reported war crimes, including new, shocking images of murdered civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, and nearly three-fourths of its members have joined to condemn Russia's invasion. But none of that has stopped Russian leader Vladimir Putin's brutal campaign to topple the Ukrainian government and subjugate the country, ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?"" Zelenskyy asked. ""It is obvious the key institution of the world ... simply cannot work effectively."" Top U.N. officials attended the session Tuesday, including Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who lamented how the war was now fueling food and fuel crises and threatening to throw more people around the world into hunger. ""For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns. ... The war in Ukraine must stop -- now,"" he told the chamber. But weeks of condemnation by Guterres and other U.N. diplomats have fallen on deaf ears in Moscow, which continues to use its prominent perch on the Security Council to spread disinformation about the war and accuse Ukraine of provocations, lies, and fakes. On Tuesday, its envoy Vasily Nebenzya again spoke repeatedly to say the atrocities reported by eyewitnesses and journalists in Bucha were ""staged."" The failure to reproach Nebenzya for his near daily false claims is yet another way the U.N.'s credibility has taken a hit during the crisis, according to some critics. In his remarks, Zelenskyy himself said the U.N. could be ""simply closed"" if it doesn't act to punish Russia for its invasion of his country -- ""if there is nothing that you can do besides conversation."" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield pushed back on that gently in an interview after the session, telling the BBC Zelensky ""is not exactly right."" ""No one can question his frustration with the council and how the council operates. The Russians do have veto power. But I have said over and over again -- they cannot veto our voices, they can't veto his voice,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. But Zelenskyy made clear that for Ukraine, that is not enough. He demanded that ""the Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately"" -- urging for ""complete truth and full accountability."" As he detailed horrific atrocities in Bucha and elsewhere - he said worse is yet to be discovered in the cities still held by Russian forces. But he also called for wholesale reform of the U.N. system -- saying that the international body has not lived up to the goals set out at its founding in San Francisco after World War II, and that those goals cannot be reached without reforms. He called for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council or for it to be reformed at a global conference, including ending the veto power. ""The veto is not the right to die,"" he added. ""No more exceptions or privileges."" There is no effort underway to expel Russia from the Security Council or the General Assembly, the U.N.'s main chamber -- where all 193 countries have a vote, but whose resolutions are non-binding. An expulsion from the U.N. requires a recommendation from the Security Council itself -- where Russia wields that veto power -- and then a vote by the General Assembly. That veto power -- shared with the four other permanent members China, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France -- has rendered the Security Council powerless to even pass a resolution condemning the Kremlin's invasion. Either way, Putin seems to care little for paper condemnations like U.N. resolutions. The night he launched his war and the bombs started to fall across Ukraine, U.N. diplomats were meeting at the same time in New York late at night to discuss the threat of war, their words ringing even more hollow. Instead of fully expelling Russia, the U.S. is pushing with its allies and partners, including Ukraine, to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. The body's 47 members are elected among U.N. member states for three-year terms, but a country can be suspended with a two-thirds majority vote in the U.N. General Assembly. ""Our votes can make a real difference. Russia's participation in the U.N. Human Rights Council hurts the council's credibility, it undermines the entire U.N., and it is just plain wrong. Let us come together to do what is right and do right by the Ukrainian people,"" Thomas-Greenfield told her fellow diplomats in the chamber. U.S. officials have said they believe they have the votes necessary -- pointing to two previous resolutions passed by the General Assembly to condemn Russia's invasion with 141 and 140 votes, respectively. A vote could be held as soon as Thursday, Thomas-Greenfield said. While only one other country has faced that kind of censure -- Libya in 2011 after Muammar Gaddafi's forces opened fire on protesters -- Russia has already dismissed the efforts, with Nebenzya vowing nothing will stop the Kremlin's campaign. ""We need to cut out the malignant Nazi tumor that is consuming Ukraine and would in time begin to consume Russia, and we will achieve that goal, I hope sooner rather than later, because there is no other outcome,"" he said.",6
"Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney will vote for Jackson. Ketanji Brown Jackson earns more bipartisan support for confirmation Three Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- have taken the political risk of breaking from their party to vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation to the Supreme Court this week, elevating the first Black woman to the nation's highest court in its 233-year history. Democrats on Monday were able to advance Jackson's nomination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a 53-47 vote, with the help of those three Republicans, putting President Joe Biden's nominee on a clear path to being confirmed later this week by the full Senate. But it's unclear if they will face blowback from constituents or colleagues as they continue to explain their reasoning. Collins was the first Republican to pledge her support to Jackson last week, after meeting twice with the nominee who she said alleviated her concerns. Murkowski and Romney's endorsements followed on Monday, to the relief of the Biden White House, which had pushed for a bipartisan vote. Jackson left ""quite an impression"" on Murkowski during her Judiciary Committee hearings, where ""she was put under some pretty, pretty intense scrutiny, and I think you saw grace under pressure there,"" Murkowski said. ""There was a level of personal attack that was not warranted,"" she added, also calling out corrosive politics around the confirmation process. ""This is an awful process it's just awful,"" Murkowski said. ""We're strapped into it, we're so divided now. We are to that point where it is almost automatic where if it is a president who is not of my party puts forth a nominee I am somehow obligated to just barely even give consideration."" Moments after Murkowski announced her intention Monday, Romney followed suit -- becoming the only Republican to reverse course and announce plans to support Jackson after previously voting against her confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last year. He told reporters Tuesday that he got to yes after becoming convinced she's within the ""mainstream."" ""In her previous confirmation votes I had concerns about whether she was in the mainstream and having spent time with her personally and reviewing her testimony before Congress I became convinced that she is in the mainstream,"" Romney said. While Jackson did, then, get the support of Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on that vote, Graham said he will vote no this time around, adding that Jackson wouldn't have been given hearings had Republicans controlled the Senate. Republicans, led by Sen Josh Hawley, R-Mo., repeatedly challenged Jackson's sentencing of child porn offenders during the proceedings in an effort to paint her as ""soft on crime"" -- a label Democrats dismissed as false. (A handful of offenders received sentences below federal guidelines from Jackson, but the prison terms were above those recommended by the probation officer, putting her in the mainstream of judicial action.) Romney, like Collins and Murkowski, also lamented Tuesday that the process of confirming Supreme Court nominees has becoming increasingly politicized. ""I think, perhaps, we are going to have to reconsider the process that we are going to pursue in the future in part because you could have a setting where you have a president of one party and a Senate of another, and maybe there will be a change,"" Romney said. ""But at this stage, I was convinced that Judge Jackson is well qualified, intelligent capable, and I became convinced that she is within the mainstream."" Collins said she was ""delighted"" to learn that her colleagues had ""reached a similar conclusion"" on Jackson's confirmation, adding she'd had ""some conversations"" with the two before they announced their positions but only learned of their support ""earlier yesterday"". She also raised concerns with the, at times, combative process wrecking the court's credibility. ""I hope we can get back to a time where we have bipartisan support for qualified Supreme Court nominees because it is important for public confidence in the court,"" Collins said. ""The court is not supposed to be a politicized institution, and if the nomination process leading up to confirmation is overly political, I believe it undermines the public's confidence in our courts and regrettably that's what we've seen with the last few nominees."" While Collins aired concerns with some of Jackson's sentences, she said in a statement that the fact she ""will not agree with every vote that she casts as a Justice...is not disqualifying.""",6
"""Our biggest fear right now is him getting home at all."" Parents of ex-Marine detained in Russia protest at White House  It's been three years since Joey and Paula Reed have seen their son Trevor, a former Marine currently held in a Russian prison, and now they're afraid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine means their chances for his return are dwindling. The couple spoke with ABC News' ""Start Here"" Tuesday and discussed the latest developments in their fight to bring their son home. Joey Reed said the situation is going ""downhill"" as communications with their son have diminished since the start of the Russian invasion and on Monday he was reportedly sent to a prison hospital. He said he fears that Russian officials may take more action against his son and other Americans currently held in their prisons and is urging President Joe Biden to act. ""Our biggest fear right now is him getting home at all. We're concerned that they're going to put additional charges, false charges on him, which that's typical FSB and or he will die,"" Joey Reed told ABC News. Trevor Reed's detention began in 2019 when his family says he was visiting a girlfriend in Moscow. The 30-year-old was arrested after Russian authorities said he allegedly assaulted a police officer while drunk. When asked by Reed's attorneys, video from inside the car, Russian authorities did not present any evidence that he grabbed the wheel or assaulted the officers. But a year later Reed was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony. Paula Reed said her family tried to raise awareness for their son's imprisonment, but they struggled to get any headway due to other topics taking up the headlines, including the start of the pandemic. ""It just seemed like Trevor couldn't get a break because every time we thought we were going to get some news out there, something bigger was happening in the world that got the attention. So it took us a long time to get our feet running on getting publicity,"" she told ABC News. The Reeds have also been calling for the release of Paul Whelan, another ex-Marine who has been imprisoned in Russia since 2020 following a conviction. The family has picked up their calls for help, and last week protested outside the White House and asked to meet with the president. ""We just thought that they would see us and it would remind someone that they need to be together for a meeting,"" Joey Reed said. Biden met with the family after their protest. The Reeds said during their meeting, which lasted over half an hour, they reiterated their calls to Biden for a prisoner exchange. ""We think that that's the only way Trevor is going to get back with any time soon,"" Paula Reed said. She added that her son is losing hope of ever returning home and pickup up his life where it left off. ""The longer he's in prison, the harder that's going to be for him to do,"" she said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that, ""during their meeting, the president reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere, and to provide all possible assistance until they and others are free and returned home to their families who are advocating so passionately for their release."" The White House declined to comment about specific details discussed between Biden and Reed's parents. The Reeds said they felt the president was mindful of their requests. ""He's a good man. He had a son in the military. He's lost children and he's compassionate,"" Joey Reed said. ""We believe that after hearing us out that I can't imagine that he's not doing something to speed up the process for bringing our son home."" In the meantime, the Reeds said that the government needs to do more to defend and bring back Americans wrongfully imprisoned abroad. ""We just want to get him out of there alive and the sooner, the better,"" Joey Reed said.",6
"Well, that was fast Elon Musk becomes Twitter's largest individual shareholder Well, that was fast. Twitter announced Tuesday, via Twitter, that it is indeed working on an edit feature for tweets. Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO and power Twitter user who is now Twitter’s largest shareholder and newly appointed board member, on Monday evening launched a Twitter poll asking users if they wanted an edit button, cheekily misspelling “yes” as “yse” and “no” as “on.” More than 4 million people had voted as of Tuesday evening. Musk also tweeted that he is looking forward to making “significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!” Many Twitter users — among them, Kim Kardashian, Ice T, Katy Perry and McDonald’s corporate account — have long begged for an edit button. The company itself recently teased users with an April Fool’s Day tweet saying “we are working on an edit button.” Its Twitter account said Tuesday that the April 1 tweet wasn't a joke and it has been working on it since last year — and that it didn't get the idea from Musk's poll. Twitter said it will test the feature in its paid service, Twitter Blue, in the coming months. It said the test would help it “learn what works, what doesn’t, and what’s possible.” So it may be a while before most Twitter users get to use it, if they do. Twitter spokesperson Catherine Hill declined to answer if it was a feature that would be rolled out for all users. Twitter’s vice president of consumer product, Jay Sullivan, tweeted Tuesday that an edit feature has for years been the most requested, since people want to fix mistakes, typos, and “hot takes.” Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had said that Twitter had considered an edit button, but in a January 2020 Q&A maintained that “we’ll probably never do it.” He cited wanting to keep the spirit of Twitter's text-message origins — texts can't be edited — and the confusion that could result from users making changes to a tweet that has already been highly circulated by others. Dorsey stepped down as CEO in November 2021. People who study Twitter also say adding an edit button would change the nature of Twitter, making it less valuable as a historical warehouse that stores official statements by politicians and other high-profile people. Twitter, for better or worse, “has become the de facto news wire,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor and an expert on social media who researches propaganda. Tweets are often embedded in news stories, which could cause problems if the users edit important or controversial tweets without leaving evidence of the original statement. Grygiel suggested instead giving Twitter users a window of time to edit their tweets before they publish them. Letting powerful Twitter users edit their tweets means they would not be historical statements anymore, Grygiel said. “We need to think about what the implications are, what these tweets are, who has power.” The company acknowledged those concerns Tuesday evening. Sullivan, tweeted, “Without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation. Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work.” Musk, too, had said that a proposal for a post-publication edit window of a few minutes “ sounds reasonable.” Musk is someone who could seemingly use an edit button. His tweet about taking Tesla private at $420 per share, when funding was not secured, led to a $40 million SEC settlement and a requirement that Musk's tweets be approved by a corporate lawyer. Musk is still embroiled in a fight over that settlement. Twitter had earlier seemed to be taking a tongue-in-cheek approach to Musk’s poll. Twitter’s CEO, Parag Agrawal, retweeted the poll with a seeming reference to an earlier tweet by Musk, saying “The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.” Musk had used the same language in a March tweet describing another one of his polls that asked whether Twitter adheres to free speech principles.",3
"The Sacramento County coroner has released the identities of the six people killed in the weekend mass shooting in California's capital Video shows response to deadly Sacramento shooting  SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A father of four. A best friend with a positive personality. A vivacious partygoer. The six people who were killed during a mass shooting in California’s capital city were remembered by their friends and family Monday as police worked to piece together what happened. Dozens of rapid-fire gunshots rang out early Sunday in the crowded streets of Sacramento, leaving three women and three men dead and another 12 people wounded. On Monday, small memorials with candles, balloons and flowers had been placed near the crime scene. Investigators were searching for at least two shooters who were responsible for the violence on the outskirts of the city’s main entertainment district that occurred as bars and nightclubs were closing. Sacramento police said Monday that they booked Dandrae Martin, 26, as a “related suspect” on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and being a convict carrying a loaded gun. Jail records said he was held without bail and was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether Martin had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Few details have been made public as investigators comb through evidence gathered from what Police Chief Kathy Lester called a complex crime scene. Witnesses have submitted more than 100 videos and photos taken during and shortly after the shooting. The Sacramento County coroner released the identities of the six people killed. They were Johntaya Alexander, 21; Melinda Davis, 57; Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21; Sergio Harris, 38; Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; and De'vazia Turner, 29. DE’VAZIA TURNER De’vazia Turner had four young children, including a 3-year-old daughter named Penelope with sticky fingers. But his bright yellow Mercedes CLS was always clean. Born and raised in Sacramento, Turner played football from a young age until a knee injury slowed him down. He worked as a manager for an inventory company, keeping a close eye on things his mother might like and letting her know when they would go on sale. “He was a protector,” his mother, Penelope Scott, said. “Raising him as a single mom, you know, he took the role of being the man of the house. He took care of everything.” He worked out with his dad, Frank Turner, five days a week. When they weren’t pumping iron, they were probably talking about cars. They both had old Buicks – Turner’s was a 1973 while his dad’s was a 1970 – and Turner had big plans for his. He had just ordered a new stereo and a steering wheel with a cherrywood finish. Frank Turner said he plans to finish his son’s car, including painting it to include images of De’vazia’s face for his kids to see. “I want them to see their daddy when they see that car,” Frank Turner said. De’vazia visited his mother on Saturday, eating leftover pork chops and taking a shower before briefly falling asleep on her couch. When he woke up, he said he was going out – a rarity for him, because he works so much, Scott said. Scott woke up at around 1 a.m. and couldn’t get back to sleep. She was looking at her phone when she got a call that her son had been killed. “Your kids are supposed to bury you. You’re not supposed to do that,” she said. “I’m grateful that he has a legacy with his children. However, you know, he’s 29. He didn’t make it to 30.” The last time Frank Turner saw his son was at the auto shop where they were working on their cars. After his son’s death, a friend called Frank Turner and told him the shop’s security cameras had picked up their conversation. He watched the video — a father and son spending time together on something they loved — and he cried. JOHNTAYA ALEXANDER Alexander was just shy of turning 22 when she was killed, her father told the Los Angeles Times. Her birthday was at the end of the month. She hoped to become a social worker who worked with children and was a doting aunt to her nieces and nephews, John Alexander told the newspaper. His daughter’s name was a combination of his own and his older sister’s, he told the Times. “She was just beginning her life,” he told the newspaper, sobbing. “Stop all this senseless shooting.” MELINDA DAVIS Davis was a “very sassy lady” who lived on the streets of Sacramento near the shooting site, The Sacramento Bee reported. Shawn Peter, a guide with the Downtown Sacramento Partnership who had known Davis for 15 years, told the newspaper that she had been homeless and lived in the area on and off for a decade. Officials had helped her find housing before the pandemic began but she had returned to the downtown business district in recent months, Peter said. A small bouquet of purple roses with a note saying “Melinda Rest In Peace” was left on the street in her memory. “Melinda was a very eccentric individual, a very sassy lady,” he told the newspaper. “This was her world, 24/7.” Davis was a periodic guest at Maryhouse, a daytime center for women and children experiencing homelessness, from 2016 to 2018, director Shannon Stevens said in an email to The Associated Press. Stevens recalled her as kind but someone who did not do well in crowds. She was seeking housing services at the time. “This was a space she came to find respite from the trauma of living on the streets of our city,” Sacramento Loaves & Fishes, which runs the Maryhouse program, said in a statement. SERGIO HARRIS Described by family members as the life of the party, Harris was a frequent presence at the London nightclub which is near the shooting scene. “My son was a very vivacious young man,” his mother, Pamela Harris, told KCRA-TV. “Fun to be around, liked to party, smiling all the time. Don’t bother people. For this to happen is crazy. I’m just to the point right now, I don’t know what to do. I don’t even feel like this is real. I feel like this is a dream.” His family members congregated at the crime scene Sunday after they hadn't heard from him for hours. Later that day, Harris was the first victim publicly identified by the coroner. “This is a sad and terrible act of violence that took the lives of many,” his wife, Leticia Harris, told KCRA-TV. “I want answers so I can have closure for my children.” YAMILE MARTINEZ-ANDRADE Martinez-Andrade was killed in front of her best friend, according to KXTV-TV. She was described as someone who “brought light to the room,” the station reported, and had a positive outlook. “There was never a dull moment with her. She has a beautiful heart and a beautiful mind. Everyone misses her so much,"" her best friend, who was not named, told KXTV-TV. JOSHUA HOYE-LUCCHESI A memorial with white and blue balloons, candles and two empty bottles of Hennessy was left a block from the shooting in honor of Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi. On the ground, someone wrote “Josh"" in what appeared to be blue paint. “I love and miss you. Foreva n my heart!"" someone wrote in black marker on a white balloon shaped like a star. “Things will never be the same,"" read another balloon.",6
"The mayor of the besieged port city of Mariupol has put the number of civilians killed there at more than 5,000 ANDRIIVKA, Ukraine -- The mayor of the besieged port city of Mariupol put the number of civilians killed there at more than 5,000 Wednesday, as Ukraine collected evidence of Russian atrocities on the ruined outskirts of Kyiv and braced for what could become a climactic battle for control of the country's industrial east. Ukrainian authorities continued gathering up the dead in shattered towns outside the capital amid telltale signs Moscow's troops killed civilians indiscriminately before retreating over the past several days. In other developments, the U.S. and its Western allies moved to impose new sanctions against the Kremlin over what they branded war crimes. And Russia completed the pullout of all of its estimated 24,000 or more troops from the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas in the north, sending them into Belarus or Russia to resupply and reorganize, probably to return to the fight in the east, a U.S. defense official speaking on condition of anonymity said. In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the Russian military continues to build up its forces in preparation for the new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas, Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland. He said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle. “We will fight and we will not retreat,” he said. “We will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won’t give them up.” Ukrainian authorities urged people living in the Donbas to evacuate now, ahead of an impending Russian offensive, while there is still time. “Later, people will come under fire,” Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, “and we won’t be able to do anything to help them.” A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence estimates, said it will take Russia's battle-damaged forces as much as a month to regroup for a major push on eastern Ukraine. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said that of the more than 5,000 civilians killed during weeks of Russian bombardment and street fighting, 210 were children. He said Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death. Boichenko said more than 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed. The attacks on the strategic southern city on the Sea of Azov have cut off food, water, fuel and medicine and pulverized homes and businesses. British defense officials said 160,000 people remained trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 430,000. A humanitarian relief convoy accompanied by the Red Cross has been trying for days without success to get into the city. Capturing Mariupol would allow Russia to secure a continuous land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. In the north, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv, victims of what Zelenskyy has portrayed as a Russian campaign of murder, rape, dismemberment and torture. Some victims had apparently been shot at close range. Some were found with their hands bound. At a cemetery in the town of Bucha, northeast of Kyiv, workers began to load more than 60 bodies apparently collected over the past few days into a grocery shipping truck for transport to a facility for further investigation. Zelenskyy accused Russia of interfering with an international investigation into possible war crimes by removing corpses and trying to hide other evidence in Bucha. “We have information that the Russian troops have changed tactics and are trying to remove the dead people, the dead Ukrainians, from the streets and cellars of territory they occupied,” he said in his address. “This is only an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more.” Switching from Ukrainian into Russian, Zelenskyy urged ordinary Russians “to somehow confront the Russian repressive machine” instead of being “equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life.” He called on Russians to demand an end to the war, “if you have even a little shame about what the Russian military is doing in Ukraine.” More bodies were yet to be collected in Bucha. The Associated Press saw two in a house in a silent neighborhood. From time to time there was the muffled boom of workers clearing the town of mines and other unexploded ordnance. Police said they found at least 20 bodies in the Makariv area west of Kyiv. In the village of Andriivka, residents said the Russians arrived in early March and took locals' phones. Some people were detained, then released. Others met unknown fates. Some described sheltering for weeks in cellars normally used for storing vegetables for winter. The soldiers were gone, and Russian armored personnel carriers, a tank and other vehicles sat destroyed on both ends of the road running through the village. Several buildings were reduced to mounds of bricks and corrugated metal. Residents struggled without heat, electricity or cooking gas. “First we were scared, now we are hysterical,” said Valentyna Klymenko, 64. She said she, her husband and two neighbors weathered the siege by sleeping on stacks of potatoes covered with a mattress and blankets. “We didn’t cry at first. Now we are crying.” To the north of the village, in the town of Borodyanka, rescue workers combed through the rubble of apartment blocks, looking for bodies. Mine-disposal units worked nearby. The Kremlin has insisted its troops have committed no war crimes, charging that the images out of Bucha were staged by the Ukrainians. Thwarted in their efforts to swiftly take the capital, increasing numbers of President Vladimir Putin’s troops, along with mercenaries, have been reported moving into the Donbas. At least five people were killed by Russian shelling Wednesday in the Donbas' Donetsk region, according to Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko, who urged civilians to leave for safer areas. In the Luhansk region of the Donbas, Russian bombardment set fire to at least 10 multi-story buildings and a mall in the town of Sievierodonetsk, the regional governor reported. There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries. Russian forces also attacked a fuel depot and a factory in the Dnipropetrovsk region, just west of the Donbas, authorities said. Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas since 2014. Ahead of its Feb. 24 invasion, Moscow recognized the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states. In reaction to the alleged atrocities outside Kyiv, the U.S. announced sanctions against Putin’s two adult daughters and said it is toughening penalties against Russian banks. Britain banned investment in Russia and pledged to end its dependence on Russian coal and oil by the end of the year. The European Union is also expected to take additional punitive measures, including an embargo on coal. Meanwhile, the United States and the United Kingdom boycotted an informal meeting of the Security Council called by Russia to press its baseless claims that the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine. The meeting was the latest of several moves by Russia that have led Western countries to accuse Moscow of using the U.N. as a platform for disinformation to divert attention from the war. Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky, who presided over the meeting, asserted that Ukraine, supported by the U.S., was implementing what he claimed were dangerous projects and experiments as part of a military biological program. The allegations have previously been debunked. Ukraine does own and operate a network of biological labs that have received funding and research support from the U.S. and are not a secret. The labs are part of a program that aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or man-made. The U.S. efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s program for weapons of mass destruction. ——— Oleksandr Stashevskyi and Cara Anna in Bucha, Ukraine, Edith M.

"A man arrested in connection with a weekend Sacramento shooting that killed six people and injured a dozen had been released from prison weeks earlier SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A wounded man arrested in connection with a Sacramento shooting that killed six people and injured a dozen more had been released from prison weeks earlier and was rejected for even earlier release after prosecutors argued he “clearly has little regard for human life,"" documents show. Smiley Martin, 27, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of a machine gun. Hours before Sunday’s attack, Martin had posted a live Facebook video of himself brandishing a handgun, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. Police were trying to determine if a stolen handgun found at the crime scene was used in the massacre. It had been converted to a weapon capable of automatic gunfire. They also were trying to determine whether the gun Martin brandished in his video was used, the official told the AP. He was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to publicly discuss details and spoke on condition of anonymity. Martin and his brother were among those wounded when gunfire erupted near the state Capitol at about 2 a.m. Sunday as bars were closing and patrons filled the streets. More than 100 shots were unleashed in rapid-fire succession as hundreds of people scrambled to find safety. Authorities were trying to determine if a street fight outside a nightclub may have sparked the shooting. The Sacramento County coroner identified the women killed as Johntaya Alexander, 21; Melinda Davis, 57; and Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21. The three men killed were Sergio Harris, 38; Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; and De’vazia Turner, 29. Martin remained hospitalized and will be booked on the charges when his condition improves enough for him to be jailed, a police statement said. His brother, Dandrae Martin, 26, was arrested Monday as a “related suspect” on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and being a convict carrying a loaded gun. He was not seriously wounded and made a brief appearance on the gun possession charge Tuesday in Sacramento Superior Court wearing orange jail scrubs. Investigators believe both brothers had stolen guns and are trying to determine how they got them, the law enforcement official told the AP. A 31-year-old man who was seen carrying a handgun immediately after the shooting was arrested Tuesday on a weapons charge, though police said his gun was not believed to be used in the crime. Smiley Martin has a criminal history dating back to 2013. He was released from state prison in February on probation after serving two years of a 10-year sentence for punching a girlfriend, dragging her from her home by her hair and whipping her with a belt, prosecutors said. Martin might have been released sooner, but a Parole Board rejected his bid for early release in May after prosecutors said the 2017 felony assault along with convictions for possessing an assault weapon and thefts posed “a significant, unreasonable risk of safety to the community.” Martin “clearly has little regard for human life and the law,"" and has displayed a pattern of criminal behavior from the time he was 18, a Sacramento County deputy district attorney wrote in a letter last year to the Board of Parole Hearings. It wasn’t clear if Smiley Martin had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Dandrae Martin, who was held without bail, was freed from an Arizona prison in 2020 after serving just over 1 1/2 years for violating probation in separate cases involving marijuana and aggravated assault. Defense lawyer Linda Parisi said she doesn’t know enough about the California case yet and whether she will seek his Martin’s release will depend on whether prosecutors bring stiffer charges. “If it turns out that the evidence demonstrates that this was mere presence at a scene that certainly argues more for a release,” Parisi said. “If it shows some more aggressive conduct then it would argue against it. But we don’t know that yet.” ——— Associated Press writers Stefanie Dazio, Brian Melley and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles, Don Thompson in Sacramento, Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix and News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York City contributed to this story.",6
"The pause until Aug. 31 is the sixth during the two years of the pandemic. One of U.S.’ largest student loan services agrees to $1.8B settlement President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced another extension in the pause in federal student loan payments -- this time until Aug. 31. This delay would be the sixth extension to the program in the two years of the pandemic and it comes less than a month before payments were scheduled to restart on May 1, potentially impacting millions of borrowers who have not been making payments. ""As I recognized in recently extending the COVID-19 national emergency, we are still recovering from the pandemic and the unprecedented economic disruption it caused. If loan payments were to resume on schedule in May, analysis of recent data from the Federal Reserve suggests that millions of student loan borrowers would face significant economic hardship, and delinquencies and defaults could threaten Americans’ financial stability,"" Biden said in a statement announcing the extension. Congressional Democrats has pressured Biden to extend the pause -- and it will fall right before the midterm elections, ensuring that student loan debt will be raised in races around the country. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",3
"Biden addressed the atrocities witnessed in Bucha when announcing the sanctions. White House expected to introduce new sanctions against Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters -- Maria and Katerina -- are included in the latest round of sanctions on Russia the U.S. announced on Wednesday. Before delivering unrelated remarks to the North America's Building Trades Unions Legislative Conference, President Joe Biden took to the bully pulpit to announce the new sanctions on Wednesday afternoon and to denounce the atrocities witnessed in Bucha, a suburb of Ukraine's capital city Kyiv. ""Bodies left in streets as Russian troops withdraw. Some shot in the back of head with hands tied behind their backs. Civilians executed in cold blood. Bodies dumped into mass graves. A sense of brutality and humanity left for all the world to see unapologetically,"" Biden said. ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes. Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable. And together with our allies and our partners, we're going to keep raising economic costs, and ratchet up the pain for Putin and further increased Russia's economic isolation,"" he continued. The new round of sanctions includes a ban on all new investments in Russia, increased sanctions on two major financial institutions in Russia -- Sberbank and Alfa-Bank -- as well as on major Russian state-owned enterprises, and sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members -- including Putin's daughters. ""We, along with our European allies, are adding the names to the list of Russian elites and families we are sanctioning,"" Biden added -- but not calling out Putin's daughters by name. ""Look, these oligarchs and their family members are not allowed to hold on to their wealth in Europe or the United States and keep the yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, luxury vacation homes, while children in Ukraine are being killed, displaced from their homes every single day."" According to the White House, the U.S. has sanctioned Putin's two adult daughters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's wife and daughter, as well as members of Russia's Security Council, including former president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. A senior administration official said on an earlier call with reporters that the U.S. has reason to believe that Putin and his cronies hide their wealth with family members, and said, ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden, with family members and that's why we're targeting them."" ""These individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people. Some of them are responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin's war on Ukraine. This action cuts them off from the U.S. financial system and freezes any assets they hold in the United States,"" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the sanctions. Since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in late February, the U.S. has sanctioned more than 140 oligarchs and their family members and more than 400 Russian government officials and has now fully blocked more than two-thirds of the Russian banking sector, which held about $1.4 trillion in assets before the war. In conjunction with the G-7 and European Union, the U.S. also announced Wednesday it was cutting off Russia's ability to use its previously frozen central bank funds to make debt payments -- forcing it to find other sources of dollars to avoid defaulting. In his remarks Wednesday, Biden also applauded corporate America for ""stepping up for a change"" and choosing to leave the Russian market on their own accord. ""Russia will very likely lose its status as a major economy, and it will continue a long descent into economic, financial, and technological isolation,"" a senior administration official told reporters. According to the White House, under the new sanctions, Russia's GDP will contract up to 15% this year, wiping out the last 15 years of economic gains. Inflation, already spiking above 15%, is expected to rise, and supply chains will be further disrupted as more than 600 private sector companies have already left the Russian market. ""At this rate, it will go back to Soviet-style living standards from the 1980s,"" the official added. Asked if the U.S. was concerned about any downsides to detaching Russia from the global market to the point where it would become more concerned with disrupting it, rather than getting back in, the official seemingly brushed off the concern, saying that the U.S. was using a ""negative feedback loop"" to deter Putin, but that can be stopped if Putin also stops. ""None of this is permanent. The only aspect that's permanent of the lives that he's taken away, and he can never bring those back. But the sanctions, the sanctions are designed to be able to respond to the conditions on the ground, and to create leverage for the outcome we seek,"" he said. The announcement follows Biden on Monday saying he was seeking further sanctions in response to apparent war crimes in Bucha -- but as national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned this week, the White House acknowledges that further sanctions against Russia will not change Putin's behavior overnight. ""Sanctions are intended to impose costs so Russia can't carry on these grotesque acts without paying a severe price for it,"" Sullivan said during Monday's briefing. ""We don't expect that that shift in behavior will be caused by sanctions overnight or in a week. It will take time to grind down the elements of Russian power within the Russian economy, to hit their industrial base hard, to hit the sources of revenue that have propped up this war and propped up the kleptocracy in Russia,"" he added.",6
"A security guard at the British embassy in Berlin has been extradited from Germany and charged with spying for Russia On Location: April 6, 2022 LONDON -- A security guard at the British Embassy in Berlin has been extradited from Germany and charged with spying for Russia, U.K. police said Wednesday. The Metropolitan Police force said David Ballantyne Smith, 57, was sent back to Britain on Wednesday. He faces nine charges under the Official Secrets Act related to “the collection and communication of information useful to the Russian state.” Smith is due to appear in a London court on Thursday, Police said the alleged offenses took place between October 2020 and August 2021, when Smith was arrested by German police at his home in Potsdam, southwest of Berlin. Nick Price, head of special crime and counterterrorism at Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, said Smith is accused of “seven offenses of collecting information with the intent of sending it to the Russian authorities, one of attempting communication and one of providing information to a person he believed was a member of the Russian authorities.” During the Cold War, Berlin was often dubbed “the capital of spies” because the city was on the frontlines of the confrontation between the Soviets in the East and the Americans and their western allies in the West. Espionage activities supposedly abated after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Cold War, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has once again chilled relations between Moscow and the West and put espionage back in the spotlight. On Monday, Germany expelled 40 Russian diplomats it accused of being spies.",0
"Thousands of Russian forces near Kyiv and Chernihiv have left to regroup.  Pentagon discusses sending $100 million in anti-tank weapons to Ukraine  The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 42: All Russian troops withdrawn from around Kyiv and Chernihiv The tens of thousands of Russian troops arrayed against Kyiv and Chernihiv have withdrawn north across the borders of Belarus and Russia to consolidate before likely redeploying to eastern Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""We are assessing that they have completely withdrawn from Kiev and from Chernihiv,"" the official said. But even with the Russian forces, the territory remains treacherous. ""There are some indications that they left behind mines and things like that, so the Ukrainians are being somewhat careful in some areas north of Kyiv as they begin to clear the ground and clear the territory and re-occupy it,"" the official said. On Monday, the Pentagon estimated that roughly one-third of the Russian forces apparently originally designated to take the capital remained. Before the withdrawal, there were about 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) consisting of 800-1,000 troops each in the areas north and northwest of Kyiv, and another 20 BTGs near Chernihiv, according to the official. While the U.S. hasn't yet seen these troops redeploy elsewhere in Ukraine, it's likely to happen soon, according to the official. ""Our assessment is that they won't want to spend too much time on refit and resupply because they have made a very public show of saying that they're going to prioritize their efforts on the Donbas region,"" the official said. But the timing will depend on how much work is needed to get the Russian forces back into fighting condition. ""Some of these units have been much more depleted than others, and it's possible that the Russians could combine units to make new BTGs as a result, we just we just don't know,"" the official said. Of the roughly 130 BTGs Russia dedicated to the invasion, about 80 are still inside Ukraine, according to the official. More than 30 are already in the Donbas region. US sending 'urgent' shipment of anti-tank missiles for fight in Donbas Ukrainian forces are preparing for a major fight in the east as Russia prepares as many as 40 BTGs to join 30 more battalions already in Donbas. ""They're not waiting,"" the official said. ""They are already adapting to increased Russian activity in the Donbas region and doing the best they can."" On Tuesday, the Biden administration authorized a $100 million drawdown package to ""meet an urgent Ukrainian need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. The senior U.S. defense official said this move was specifically to help in Donbas. ""One of the reasons why you saw us describe this $100 million drawdown package last night as an urgent need for Javelins was in fact because of the activity in the Donbas and the Ukrainians wanting to make sure that they're ready for increased Russian activity there,"" the official said. Ukrainians get drone training in US A small number of Ukrainians currently in the U.S. for ""professional military education"" were pulled aside for a couple days of training on Switchblade drones, which the U.S. is sending overseas as part of its military aid, according to the official. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" the official said. ""And there may be some additional rudimentary training while they're here."" The official said fewer than 12 Ukrainians were given this U.S.-based training. Pentagon blames Russia for nitric acid explosion The official said the Pentagon is ""monitoring"" an apparent nitric acid explosion in the Luhansk region, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. ""We've seen the Russians claim that this was a Ukrainian attack on this. We do not believe that is true,"" the official said. ""We do believe that the Russians are responsible, but exactly what they used when they did it, why they did it, what the damage is, we just don't have that level of detail,"" the official said. 'Premeditated' Russian atrocities in Bucha ""When you see individuals with their hands tied behind their backs and evidence of being shot in the head, that certainly appears to be premeditated,"" the official said, again calling for Russian war crimes in Ukraine to be investigated. Long-range strikes shifting east Russia has now launched more than 1,450 missiles against Ukraine, according to the official. The Pentagon is seeing more airstrikes targeting the east than Kyiv as Russia shifts its overall focus to the Donbas region.",6
"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the military alliance would quickly welcome Finland and Sweden into the fold if they decided to apply On Location: April 6, 2022 BRUSSELS -- NATO would quickly welcome Finland and Sweden into its ranks with open arms if they decided to apply, the military alliance’s top civilian official said Wednesday, as Russia’s war on Ukraine spurs public support in the two Nordic countries for membership. The military organization might also be ready to provide security guarantees to the countries if any potential membership bid angers Russia, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. A poll last month by Finnish broadcaster YLE showed that, for the first time, more than 50% of Finns support joining the Western military alliance. In neighboring Sweden, a similar poll showed that those in favor of NATO membership outnumber those against. “If they decide to apply, I expect that all allies will welcome them,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels, as NATO foreign ministers met to discuss the war in Ukraine. “We know that they can easily join this alliance if they decide to apply.” Before launching the war on Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin demanded that the 30-nation military organization stop expanding and pull its troops back from Russia’s borders. So the prospect of neighboring Finland, and Sweden, joining is unlikely to be welcomed in Moscow. To shield them, Stoltenberg said NATO member countries might be prepared to provide a security guarantee to cover the two neutral nations from when they announce a possible membership bid until their applications are endorsed. Once members, they would benefit from NATO’s collective defense clause, which obliges all members to come to the aid of any ally that comes under attack. “I am certain that we will find ways to address concerns they may have regarding the period between the potential application and the final ratification,” Stoltenberg said. He declined to speculate about what those security guarantees might involve. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said his country’s lawmakers are due this month to debate a government white paper on security, including an option for NATO accession. He said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has changed public opinion. “In three or four weeks we have a majority, first time ever” in favor of joining, Haavisto said. He said Finland knows that “Russia is ready to take bigger risks, as we can see in Ukraine, bigger risks also for its own security. We can also see that Russia is capable of gathering more than 100,000 men against just one country, even without touching its reserves.” Haavisto added that “the threshold has been lowered, at least in the debate,” on Russia’s possible use of tactical nuclear or chemical weapons. He too was reluctant to go into detail about any security guarantee that Finland might need, particularly as debate about joining continues at home. But Haavisto did say it’s something that his country would want to discuss with “key” NATO members, and that Finnish leaders have been in contact with U.S. President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"The U.N. General Assembly will vote Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the U.N.’s premiere human rights body New sanctions on Russia today UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. General Assembly will vote Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the U.N.’s premiere human rights body. The move was initiated by the United States in response to the discovery of hundreds of bodies after Russian troops withdrew from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, sparking calls for its forces to be tried for war crimes. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians. The videos and reporting from the town have sparked global revulsion and calls for tougher sanctions on Russia, which has vehemently denied responsibility. “We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said Monday. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.” General Assembly spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said Wednesday the assembly’s emergency special session on Ukraine will resume at 10am EDT on Thursday when the resolution “to suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of the Russian Federation” will be put to a vote. While the Human Rights Council is based in Geneva, its members are elected by the 193-nation General Assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the Human Rights Council states that the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.” The brief resolution to be voted on expresses “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights.” To be approved, the resolution requires a two-thirds majority of assembly members that vote “yes” or “no.” Abstentions don’t count. The General Assembly voted 140-5 with 38 abstentions on March 24 on a resolution blaming Russia for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools and hospitals critical to their survival. The vote was almost exactly the same as for the March 2 resolution the assembly adopted demanding an immediate Russian cease-fire, withdrawal of all its forces and protection for all civilians. That vote was 141-5 with 35 abstentions. Thomas-Greenfield said Monday that her message to the 140 members who voted in favor of those two resolutions to support Russia’s suspension from the Human Rights Council is simple: “The images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us now to match our words with action.” “We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council,” she said. Russia’s ambassador in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, called the U.S. action “unfounded and purely emotional bravado that looks good on camera -- just how the U.S. likes it.” “Washington exploits the Ukrainian crisis for its own benefit in an attempt either to exclude or suspend Russia from international organizations,” Gatilov said, in comments relayed by a Russian diplomatic mission spokesman. Russia and the other four veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, and the United States — all currently have seats on the Human Rights Council, which the U.S. rejoined this year. The only country to have its membership rights stripped at the council was Libya in 2011, when upheaval in the North African country brought down longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi, said council spokesman Rolando Gomez. No permanent member of the Security Council has ever had its membership revoked from any U.N. body.",6
"Investigators say gang violence is at the center of the shooting. At least 1 suspect in custody after Sacramento mass shooting Sacramento police say at least five men were involved in last weekend's mass shooting that left six people dead and a dozen injured. Investigators said Wednesday that number could grow as they piece together clues. The police said in a statement that it ""is increasingly clear that gang violence is at the center of this tragedy."" ""While we cannot at this time elaborate on the precise gang affiliation of individuals involved, gangs and gang violence are inseparable from the events that drove these shootings,"" the police said in a statement. A fight broke out before gunfire went off in downtown Sacramento early Sunday morning, police said. The victims were identified by the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office on Monday as Johntaya Alexander, 21; Melinda Davis, 57; Sergio Harris, 38; Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21; and Devazia Turner, 29. Two suspects, Smiley Martin, 27, and his brother, Dandrae Martin, 26, have been arrested  in connection with the shooting. Smiley Martin was charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of a machine gun. while the younger Martin was charged with assault and possession of an illegal firearm, police said. Smiley Martin has a long criminal history and was just released from prison in January. A third person, Daviyonne Dawson, 31, was arrested for possession of a firearm following the incident, but he is not believed to be directly related to the shooting. The Sacramento police said it has received nearly 200 videos, photographs and other pieces of evidence from the public. ""The suffering inflicted by gang violence does not limit itself to gang members. It spills over to claim and shatter innocent lives and harm our entire community,"" Sacramento Police Chief Kathy Lester said in a statement.",6
"Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino have been held in contempt for ignoring subpoenas. Capitol insurrection: Tracking the attack 1 year later The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to hold Trump White House officials Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas for records and testimony from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack Both cases will now be sent to the Justice Department, which will decide whether to pursue criminal charges against both men. Each contempt charge carries up to a $100,000 fine and up to one year in jail. Republican Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger voted to approve the measure along with all Democrats. Navarro, officially a trade adviser in the Trump White House, wrote a series of reports in the weeks following the 2020 presidential election claiming that the election was stolen from Trump. He was also in contact with Trump ally Steve Bannon about an effort to delay Congress' certification of the election and to overturn the results, a plan Navarro dubbed the ""Green Bay Sweep"" in his book, ""In Trump Time,"" the committee wrote in its report recommending the House contempt vote. Navarro spoke to Bannon on Jan. 6 and encouraged Trump associates to contact Trump ally Roger Stone to discuss Jan. 6 plans, while encouraging hundreds of state legislators to ""take action"" ahead of the certification of the election results. He has deferred to Trump and claimed that the committee needs to negotiate with the former president over executive privilege. The Biden White House has waived executive privilege for Scavino, Navarro, and others, saying the committee's probe is in the nation's interest. Last year the Supreme Court rejected Trump's bid to block the committee from obtaining his White House records from the National Archives. Scavino, who first served as a golf caddy for Trump before moving on to join his family business, presidential campaign, and administration, helped manage Trump's Twitter account and social media presence. The committee has argued that in addition to his close contact and communication with Trump, Scavino was responsible for several of Trump's inflammatory Twitter messages ahead of the Capitol riot in Jan. of 2021 -- and was following right-wing social media accounts and conversations that suggested the potential for violence in Washington on Jan. 6. ""Mr. Scavino worked directly with President Trump to spread President Trump's false message that the election was stolen,"" Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, said on the House floor. Republicans who spoke on the House floor prior to the vote attacked the select committee and accused Democrats of trying to target Trump to damage his political standing, and distract from record-high inflation and the increasing number of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border. ""The American people can see through this charade and wants this witch hunt to end,"" Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Tx., said on the House floor. Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and other members of the committee said Wednesday that close to 800 witnesses had appeared before the committee -- including Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner -- and that investigators have obtained roughly 90,000 pages of records. ""Every citizen has a duty to comply with a subpoena,"" Cheney said. Already the House has voted to refer chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump ally Steve Bannon to the Justice Department for defying the committee's subpoenas. The Justice Department indicted Bannon, who has pleaded not guilty. A trial is expected to begin this summer. The department has not taken action on the Meadows referral, frustrating some Democrats in Congress and on the committee.",3
"Ukraine's president has accused Russian forces of committing genocide.  What is genocide and has the legal threshold been crossed in Ukraine? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide after he said hundreds of civilians were found dead in the town of Bucha following the Russian military's withdrawal. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were killed in Bucha, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range. Russia's defense ministry said in a statement Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and claimed no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Russia has claimed all its units withdrew completely from Bucha around March 30. An ABC News analysis of videos and satellite imagery confirms some of the bodies seen lying in the streets of Bucha were there as early as March 19, when the town was still occupied by Russian forces, contradicting Russia's claims that the scene was ""staged"" after its troops left. President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and the alleged acts committed by Russian troops ""war crimes,"" but fell short of calling it genocide. Experts say this could, in part, be a political decision. ""To say that a genocide is occurring, is also to say, we can't sit on our hands and do nothing here,"" David Simon, a senior lecturer and the director of the Genocide Studies program at Yale University, told ABC News. The U.S. government also has an internal process for designating whether genocide has occurred. It took the State Department five years to designate that a genocide had occurred in Myanmar, Simon said. This story explains the legal term ""genocide"" in relation to the war in Ukraine. What is genocide? Genocide is defined as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" according to the United Nations' Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Acts of genocide against members of a group listed in the convention include killings; causing them serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting life conditions calculated to being about its physical destruction; imposing measures to prevent births; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Genocide is not just any large scale violence, or violence that becomes particularly gruesome or grisly, Simon said. There has to be intent by the perpetrators to destroy the group, he said. Killings are also not the only form of genocide that could have occurred in Ukraine, another expert said. ""Other attempts to diminish the group, by placing them in harsh conditions of life, like if you think about starving a group to death, and you actually think of some cities in Ukraine today, where through bombardment and cutting off the flow of humanitarian aid, people are potentially going to be starving,"" Alex Hinton, the director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights and UNESCO Chair on Genocide Prevention, told ABC News. Whether or not these violent acts allegedly committed by Russian forces against civilians are found to be acts of genocide, they are illegal under international law and warrant a response from the international community, Simon said. ""What we're seeing in Ukraine almost certainly involves crimes against humanity, war crimes, and then to less well defined terms, ethnic cleansing and mass atrocities,"" Simon said. Legal threshold for defining genocide The legal definition of genocide does not define a threshold for an amount of violence that has to have happened in order for it to be considered genocide. ""The importance of intent within the definition of genocide means really, that there is no legal threshold. Particularly because the convention says the 'intent destroy in whole or in part',"" Simon said. In practice, though, Simon said the possibility of genocide has usually come up when the number of deaths are in the thousands. As of Wednesday, at least 1,480 civilians have been killed and 2,195 others have been injured in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Consequences for genocide  The U.N.'s convention on genocide tells countries to take claims to one of the organs of the United Nations for the further prevention and suppression of acts of genocide. However, with Russia's veto power, it is unlikely the Security Council, the organ primarily responsible for ensuring international peace and security, would be able to take action, Simon said. There are a number of things states or geopolitical actors can do, Hinton said. Organizations, including Human Rights Watch, and government actors are currently on the ground gathering evidence for a possible trial of those who may have committed crimes. An inquiry could also be launched to investigate the alleged war crimes committed. The International Criminal Court has begun active investigations into potential war crimes committed, but Simon said it could take years for this to be litigated. ""In most cases, the ICC is able to act only after a conflict is essentially over,"" Simon said. The ICC's investigation into crimes committed in Myanmar is still primarily in the investigation phase, despite the most intense parts of the violence happening in 2017, Simon said. Investigators will need to prove it was Russia's intent to destroy Ukraine or Ukrainians as a group. This evidence would be any articulation of the idea on social media, public broadcasts, in writing or even private communications, Simon said. But, ""there can be no actual case until those individuals that are under warrant are arrested and brought to the Hague for trial,"" Simon said. Radovan Karadzic, who committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia during 1992 and 1993, and was convicted in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, was at large until 2008. ""His trial, which included genocide charges, took place something like a decade and a half after the acts he undertook,"" Simon said. Experts say leaders should act either way This violence could push actors to take a stronger stance against Russia, which could have included military action if Russia wasn't a nuclear power, Simon said. Biden has repeatedly said American troops will not join the war in Ukraine, warning that going head-to-head would lead to 'World War III.' Biden has also denied requests from Zelenskyy for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""But it may push Europeans to have more of a taste to expand sanctions to include Russian exports of gas and oil, which could be far more devastating to the Russian economy than the sanctions that are in place up to this point,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed that additional sanctions could be imposed, but said lines of diplomacy need to be kept open, Hinton said. ""There has to be a way to get out of the conflict, so diplomacy is absolutely critical,"" Hinton said. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators last held virtual talks on Friday where they discussed the proposed security guarantee treaty. Ukraine proposed a new system of security guarantees similar to NATO's collective defense clause which would legally require ""guarantor countries"" to provide arms and impose a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine, in the event of an attack. Simon said the term ""genocide"" can often be used politically, to describe crimes that do not fit its legal definition. ""People tend to use genocide as a label for anything that upsets them. Indeed, the Russians have used Neo-Nazis and genocide against Russians as the pretext for invading in the first place, when there's absolutely no evidence of anything, especially intent to destroy Russians within Ukraine,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed, saying, ""genocide has always from the very beginning, been a sort of political football. It's used and misused by states to serve their interest."" A designation that the crimes committed against Ukrainian civilians amounts to genocide should not make a difference in the response, according to Simon. ""There are clearly violations of international law that are causing great harm to civilian populations. And that alone should should trigger a stronger response,"" he said. ""We have enough evidence of crimes against humanity, that if we think that mass atrocities are a reason for ratcheting up pressure, militarily or otherwise, against the perpetrator force, we have that evidence with us now and we don't need to have a determination of genocide to decide whether or not we find bodies in the street of Bucha repulsive or revolting,"" Simon said.",2
"Europe's ready to ban Russian coal imports Putin’s daughters targeted with sanctions The European Union is poised to ban Russian coal in the first sanctions on the vital energy industry over the war in Ukraine, but it has underlined the 27 nations' inability to agree on a much more sweeping embargo on oil and natural gas that would hit Russia harder but risk recession at home. The coal ban, expected to be approved in a new package of sanctions this week, would cost Russia 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) a year, the EU’s executive commission said. Energy analysts and coal importers say Europe could replace Russian supply in a few months from other countries, including the U.S. The move is significant because it breaks the taboo on severing Europe's energy ties with Russia. It's also certain to fuel already record-high inflation. But compared with natural gas and oil, coal is by far the easiest to cut off quickly and inflicts far less damage on Russian President Vladimir Putin's war chest and the European economy. The EU pays Russia $20 million a day for coal — but $850 million a day for oil and gas. Shocking pictures of bodies in the Ukrainian town of Bucha are keeping discussion of broader sanctions alive, with EU officials saying they're working on targeting Russian oil. While the EU ponders additional sanctions, Italian Premier Mario Draghi said no embargo of Russian natural gas is up for consideration now. “And I don’t know if it ever will be on the table,’’ he told reporters Wednesday. EU countries, especially big economies like Italy and Germany, rely heavily on Russian natural gas to heat and cool homes, generate electricity and keep industry churning. Still, Draghi said, “the more horrendous this war gets, the allied countries will ask, in the absence of our direct participation in the war, what else can this coalition of allies do to weaken Russia, to make it stop.” In case a gas embargo is proposed, Italy “will be very happy to follow it” if that would make peace possible, Draghi said. “If the price of gas can be exchanged for peace ... what do we choose? Peace? Or to have the air conditioning running in the summer?"" For now, even the coal ban brings worrying consequences for politicians and consumers. Germany and EU members in Eastern Europe still generate a large share of their power from coal despite a yearslong transition toward cleaner energy sources. “The coal ban means European consumers will have to brace for high power prices throughout this year,” according to a Rystad Energy statement. Higher prices in countries that use more coal will spread across the EU through its well-connected power grid, the energy research company said. That will bring more pain. Europe has been facing high energy prices for months over a supply crunch, and jitters over the war have sent them even higher. Governments already have been rolling out cash support and tax relief for consumers hit by higher utility bills. High energy prices have pushed inflation in the 19 member countries that use the euro currency to a record 7.5%. Commodities analyst Barbara Lambrecht at German bank Commerzbank said EU governments likely could agree on a coal embargo because it would take effect after three months and only apply to new contracts. The downside is the limited impact on Russia, with coal only 3.5% of its exports and only a quarter going to the EU. Germany’s coal importer’s association said Russian coal could be completely replaced from the U.S., South Africa, Colombia, Mozambique and Indonesia “by next winter” — at higher prices. European coal futures prices jumped after the EU announced the coal proposal, from around $255 per ton to $290 per ton. The big debate remains oil and natural gas, with the European Union dependent on Russia for 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil. It's tougher for Europe to cut off than the U.S., which imported little Russian oil and no gas and has banned both. Yet European Council President Charles Michel said, “I believe that measures on oil and even on gas will also be needed sooner or later.” It's difficult for the EU to agree on energy sanctions because countries like Germany, Italy and Bulgaria are much more dependent on Russian gas in particular than others. Europe has scrambled to get additional gas through pipelines from Norway and Algeria and with more liquefied gas that comes by ship, but those global supplies are limited. For now, the EU's plan is to cut dependence on Russian gas by two-thirds by year's end and completely over the next several years by stepping up alternative supplies, conservation and wind and solar. Germany has reduced its reliance on Russian natural gas from 55% to 40%, but the government says the consequences to jobs from a cutoff would be too great. Germany's steelmaking association, for instance, has warned of forced shutdowns that would throw people out of their jobs or onto government support and send shortages of basic parts rippling through the rest of the economy. Energy Minister Robert Habeck says the country will halt Russian coal this summer, oil by year's end and gas in mid-2024. Oil would be easier to ban than natural gas, because like coal, there's a large and liquid global market for oil and it comes mostly by ship, not fixed pipeline like gas. But it's not problem-free either. Russia is the world's largest oil exporter, with 12% of global supply. Taking its oil to Europe off the market would drive up prices from other exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, when supplies are already tight. Russia might simply sell the oil to India and China, which aren't taking part in sanctions — although the price Moscow gets might be lower. The economic hit from a full energy cutoff range from a drop of 1.2% to 2.2% of gross domestic product in the 19 countries using the euro, plus 2 percentage points of additional inflation, recent economist estimates say. ——— This story has been corrected to show that the EU pays $20 million for coal and $850 million for oil and gas every day, not those amounts in euros.",9
"Congress has overwhelmingly voted to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and ban the importation of its oil, ratcheting up the U.S. response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine amid reports of atrocities What is genocide and has the legal threshold been crossed in Ukraine? WASHINGTON -- Congress voted overwhelmingly Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and ban the importation of its oil, ratcheting up the U.S. response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine amid reports of atrocities. House action came after the Senate approved the two bills with 100-0 votes. The measures now go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. Lawmakers overwhelmingly support the substance of the two bills, but they had languished for weeks in the Senate as lawmakers worked to hammer out the final details. Biden has already taken executive action to ban Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal to the United States. The legislation puts the effort into law. The bill to end normal trade relations with Russia paves the way for Biden to enact higher tariffs on various imports, such as certain steel and aluminum products, further weakening the Russian economy under President Vladimir Putin. It also ensures Belarus receives less favorable tariff treatment. Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., said innocent Ukrainians were being slaughtered even as lawmakers were meeting. “We have no time to waste and must immediately further punish Vladimir Putin,” Neal said. “What we have witnessed in Bucha over the course of the last 72 hours alone more than justifies the positions we have taken in the past and to be more assertive and aggressive going into the future.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced late Wednesday a breakthrough in negotiations to bring the bills up for votes before lawmakers travel back to their home states and congressional districts for two weeks. Some lawmakers said that the failure to take final action on the bills was sending the wrong message to allies and to Russia. “Now, I wish this could have happened sooner, but after weeks of talks with the other side, it’s important that we have found a path forward,” Schumer said. Schumer said the images coming out of Ukraine as the war drags on “are pure, pure evil. Hundreds of civilians murdered in cold blood.” “No nation whose military is committing war crimes deserves free trade status with the United States,” Schumer said moments before the vote. While there was overwhelming support for suspending preferential trade treatment for Russia, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked speedy consideration of the bill over concerns that its language on who can be sanctioned for human rights abuses is too broad, leaving it ripe for abuse. A few other Republicans had voiced similar concerns. Schumer opted to let senators work behind the scenes on language that lawmakers from both parties and the White House could accept, rather than chew up floor time to overcome the filibuster. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said, practically speaking, the impact of the delay on the trade bill is minimal “because there’s virtually no trade right now coming in from Russia.” Still, he said passage of the bill is important. “Messaging is important here and showing action is important,” Cardin said. “You’ve got the Ukrainians on the battlefield every day. The least we can do is get these bills passed.” The bill also provides the president with the authority to return normal tariff treatment for Russia as well as resume trade in Russian energy products subject to certain conditions. While Russian oil makes up only a small part of U.S. imports, it carries a high price for lawmakers in Congress who viewed the ban as a moral test in blocking an economic lifeline for Putin’s regime. The White House says that sanctions the U.S. and more than 30 other nations have already enacted have stung the Russian economy. It said that experts are now predicting Russia’s GDP will contract up to 15% this year and that inflation is already spiking above 15%. More than 600 private sectors companies have already left the market. “Russia will very likely lose its status as a major economy, and it will continue a long descent into economic, financial, and technological isolation,” the White House report said.",6
"Russia is the second country ever to be suspended.  What is genocide and has the legal threshold been crossed in Ukraine? The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted to pass a resolution to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, in response to Russian forces' alleged killings of civilians in Ukraine. The vote passed with 93 countries voting in favor, 24 voting against and 58 abstaining from voting. Belarus, China, Iran, Russia and Syria were among the countries who voted against the resolution. The vote came amid global outrage over the alleged killings of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, after Russian forces withdrew from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. The UNGA needed a two-thirds majority to suspend Russia, now the second country ever suspended after the UNGA voted to remove Libya from the Human Rights Council in 2011 in response to Moammar Gadhafi's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters. In a speech before the vote, a Ukrainian representative urged the assembly to remove Russia from the council. ""Suspension of Russia from the human rights council is not an option, but a duty,"" Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's permanent representative to the United Nations, said. Speaking after the vote, Russia's deputy permanent member Gennady Kuzmin called the UNGA's decision ""an illegitimate and politically motivated step with the aim of demonstratively punishing a sovereign member state of the U.N.,"" even going as far as calling it ""open blackmail of sovereign states."" He also claimed the council is ""monopolized by one group of states who use it for their short-term aims,"" and that ""such actions violate the mandate entrusted by the international community on the Human Rights Council and overall undermine trust in this body."" After the vote was completed, Kuzmin said Russia made the decision to end its membership with the Human Rights Council on Thursday. James Roscoe, a UK diplomat, then asked Russia to clarify, and said, ""That sounds like someone who has just been fired, then tendering their resignation."" Kuzmin responded, ""I think we made a very clear statement."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reacted to the vote as he took the stage for a NATO press conference in Brussels. ""A country that's perpetuating gross and systematic violations of human rights should not sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights. Today a wrong was righted,"" Blinken said during his opening statement. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told CNN on Wednesday that they ""absolutely"" have the votes to suspend Russia. ""We have been working very, very hard since this war started to build a coalition of countries who are prepared to condemn Russia. We got 141 votes, the first time we went into the General Assembly. The second time we got 140. And I have no doubt that we can defeat Russia here on the Human Rights Council,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. She added: ""They don't deserve to be on the Human Rights Council."" For more coverage: ABC News' Aaron Katersky reports:  -ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report",6
"""This is nothing new for the Russian Army,"" a U.S. congressman tells ABC News. What is genocide and has the legal threshold been crossed in Ukraine? In one of the creepiest allegations to emerge from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin is being accused by Ukrainian officials of using ""mobile crematoriums"" to incinerate dead civilians in a deliberate effort to cover-up alleged war crimes in the hard-hit city of Mariupol. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko made the charge this week, saying he heard eyewitness accounts of Russian soldiers driving around Mariupol with crematoriums on lorries and collecting bodies of civilians while at the same time barring the International Committee of the Red Cross from entering the city with humanitarian aid. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazis concentration camps,"" Boychenko said on Tuesday. ""The Russians have turned our entire city into a death camp. Unfortunately, the creepy analogy is getting more and more confirmation."" In a statement released on its Facebook account, the Mariupol City Council said, ""witnesses have seen evidence Russia is operating mobile crematoria in Mariupol, burning the bodies of dead civilians and covering up evidence of war crimes."" The statement added ""this is why Russia is not in a hurry"" to let the ICRC and other human rights watch groups into Mariupol to rescue civilians still trapped there. Boychenko and the city council said the portable human furnaces showed up in Mariupol after reports of alleged atrocities at the hands of Russian troops emerged in Bucha, a suburb of the capital city Kyiv. Ukrainian officials reported that at least 410 civilians were killed in Bucha, including many found with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Boychenko said his once-thriving port city of 400,000 people has been completely decimated by bombing raids and estimated that around 5,000 people there have been killed. U.S. defense officials told ABC News they have not confirmed the allegations that Russia is using mobile crematoriums to hide evidence of war crimes. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, told ABC News on Thursday that he is not surprised by the reports. Moulton, a former Marine and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that during a 2015 fact-finding mission in Ukraine that he went on with other House members, ""credible sources"" informed him that the Russian Army was using mobile crematoriums on its own soldiers in the Russian occupied Crimea, Ukraine. He said the sources told him Russia was using the devices to cover up the number of its soldiers killed in Crimea. ""We heard this from a variety of sources over there, enough that I was confident in the veracity of the information,"" Moulton said. ""None of that has changed. That is absolutely what was going on back then and I'm now hearing reports, unsurprisingly, that it's happening again."" Moulton said he has no reason to discount reports from Ukrainian officials that Russia is using the incinerators to hide new war crimes. ""The bottom line is this is nothing new for the Russian Army and Vladimir Putin,"" Moulton said. In an interview with Turkish media this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged that Russian soldiers were ""cleaning up"" before allowing aid workers into the heavily bombed Mariupol. Pressure has been mounting from the international community to bring war crimes against Putin and other Russian officials. The international criminal court in The Hague has launched an investigation into the atrocities allegedly committed against Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops since the invasion started on Feb. 24. A report released Thursday by Amnesty International claims Russian forces have committed numerous war crimes throughout Ukraine. The organization said its crisis response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns near Kyiv and many claimed to have witnessed civilian executions. The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted to pass a resolution to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council in response to Russian forces' alleged killings of civilians in Ukraine. ""I'm not sure who needs more proof that Russia is committing war crimes,"" Moulton told ABC News. ""They're trying to cover their tracks."" Russia has denied committing atrocities and targeting civilians.",6
"Lessons from her nomination will likely be as divided as the political climate. Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed to Supreme Court in historic vote Supreme Court confirmation battles are typically remembered for a few searing or pithy exchanges -- or, just as likely, not at all. The memories of and lessons drawn from Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's successful nomination, though, are likely to be as divided as the political climate that produced them. That means partisan takeaways that confirm particular worldviews of 2022 -- and, just maybe, a different path that points toward a less overheated political climate. Jackson's nomination elicited soaring pride from many Democrats, an emotional reaction driven by her unique life story, deep qualifications, and, with Thursday's 53-47 Senate vote, her place in history. The Supreme Court will now have its first Black woman justice, and Jackson will serve on the first-ever high court where white men constitute a minority of the membership. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., quoted a famous Maya Angelou poem in celebrating Jackson's committee vote on Monday: ""You may try to write me down in history with your bitter, twisted lies. You may trod me down in the very dirt. But still, like dust, I rise."" It's fair to say that most Senate Republicans saw the moment differently. For them, Jackson's nomination was a chance to prosecute Democratic policies and settle scores from past nomination fights -- with sometimes strange detours into matters including sentencing for child porn offenses, defining what a woman is and determining whether babies are racist. Speaking on the Senate floor this week, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., drew an explosive historical through-line connecting the late Justice Robert Jackson to the woman who will now be the newest Justice Jackson, referencing her work as a federal public defender on behalf of suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay. ""The last Judge Jackson left the Supreme Court to go to Nuremberg and prosecute the case against the Nazis. This Judge Jackson might have gone there to defend them,"" Cotton said. President Joe Biden's decision to name a Black woman to the court meant that it was perhaps inevitable that the confirmation battle would showcase racial tensions as well as political opportunism. With Democrats controlling 50 Senate votes as well as the vice-presidential ?tiebreaker, there was little doubt from the start that Jackson would be confirmed. But three Republican senators wound up breaking with their party and voting for her -- not a huge number, yet a significant marker for who they are and where they want to go from here. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, break fairly regularly with their party on judicial appointments. Both support abortion rights and had voted to confirm Jackson less than a year ago to her most recent federal judgeship, and both said they felt that Jackson's qualifications merited her confirmation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., joined them in voting for Jackson last year for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He made clear in his questioning last month, though, that she would be held to account, in part, for how Democrats handled previous Supreme Court confirmations. In explaining his ""no"" vote now, he blamed what he called her ""judicial activism"" as well as sentencing in child pornography cases that were part of the public record before last year. The biggest surprise came from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who did the opposite of Graham in voting for Jackson on Thursday after voting against her last year. Romney said he dug ?into her record and met with her to help establish in his mind that she is ""within the mainstream"" and therefore worthy of confirmation. Like Collins and Murkowski, Romney expressed concern about what it means to have Supreme Court justices confirmed strictly along party lines. Romney offered a characteristically understated indictment of his colleagues in explaining his vote to reporters: ""Perhaps we are going to have to reconsider the process that we are going to pursue in the future."" Romney was the most recent Republican nominee for president before former President Donald Trump, though that description significantly overstates his sway in the modern GOP. It's also worth noting that Trump's three Supreme Court nominees got a total of five Democratic votes, picking up four for Justice Neil Gorsuch, one for Justice Brett Kavanaugh and then zero for Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Modern court confirmation battles combine some of the worst grievances and grudges accumulated over decades with some of the worst new tactics of demonization. Another lasting image of Jackson's confirmation might be the shot of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, checking his Twitter mentions moments after an aggressive round of questions directed at his former Harvard Law School classmate. In another slice of choose-your-own-reality politics, Jackson's ascension to the high court may change nothing in terms of the Supreme Court's ideology, given that she is replacing Justice Stephen Breyer, whom she once clerked for and remains close with. At the same time, it may change everything when it comes to representation on the court. Similarly, the process that got her to the Supreme Court speaks volumes about the state of modern politics without changing very much at all. As with so much in 2022, you can watch the same events play out and come away with starkly divergent views of why it matters.",6
"The European Union has imposed sanctions on two adult daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, according to two EU officials US targets Putin's daughters with sanctions BRUSSELS -- The European Union has imposed sanctions on two adult daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia's economy, businessmen and oligarchs in retaliation for the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, according to two EU officials. The EU included Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova in its updated list of individuals facing an assets freeze and travel ban. The two EU officials from different EU member countries spoke Friday on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because the updated list of individuals and entities sanctioned has not been published yet. The move from the European bloc follows a similar move two days earlier by the United States. In the wake of evidence of torture and killings emerging from war zones outside Kyiv, the EU decided to impose a fifth package of measures. “These latest sanctions were adopted following the atrocities committed by Russian armed forces in Bucha and other places under Russian occupation,"" said Josep Borrell, the EU's top diplomat. “The aim of our sanctions is to stop the reckless, inhuman and aggressive behavior of the Russian troops and make clear to the decision makers in the Kremlin that their illegal aggression comes at a heavy cost."" But many in the Ukraine government want tougher measures that will have a quicker impact on the war. “Some countries may want to exhaust the Russians economically rather than stop them, while the Ukrainians are shedding their blood. We don’t accept that,” said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk “The idea of the sanctions should be not just to exhaust the Russians in the longer term, but to stop them within months, not years.” In addition to sanctions on individuals and members of their families, oligarchs and high-ranking Kremlin officials, the 27-nation bloc also formally approved Friday an embargo on coal imports starting in August, as well as a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks representing 23% of market share in the Russian banking sector. Also, vessels registered under the Russian flag are now prohibited to access EU ports, with an exception for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy. This is the first time that EU sanctions target Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine. According to the EU council, imports of coal into the region are currently worth 8 billion euros per year. The EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports. EU officials said the impact of the bloc’s sanctions so far over the first four weeks shows that imports into the 27 nations from Russia dropped off by 9% in terms of value, and over 20% in terms of volume. Trade from the EU to Russia has fallen by three quarters. ——— Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this story.",6
"China has called reports of civilian killings in Ukraine disturbing and urged further investigation, even while declining to blame Russia BEIJING -- China has described reports and images of civilian killings in Ukraine as disturbing, and urged that they be further investigated, even while declining to blame Russia. That's drawn questions about the resiliency of Beijing’s support for Moscow, but speculation that it is weakening appears to be misplaced. Here’s a deeper look at where China stands at this stage of the conflict: IS CHINA SERIOUS ABOUT PROBING ATROCITIES? In his statement Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian referred to reports of atrocities in the town of Bucha, saying, “The truth and the cause of the incident must be verified."" He said that all parties should exercise restraint and avoid “unfounded accusations before a conclusion of the investigation.” Crucially, Zhao did not mention Russian forces and gave no indication of how evidence should be gathered or by whom. China has a lengthy history of providing political cover for its friends after incidents such as the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010. China called that “unfortunate,"" but refused to accept evidence North Korea was responsible. Beijing also routinely turns accusations of war crimes back on the accusers, mainly the U.S., citing the Iraq invasion and incidents such as NATO’s 1999 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. China has never accepted NATO’s claim that the attack was unintended. WHERE DOES CHINA STAND ON RUSSIA'S INVASION? Beijing early on committed itself to the position that Russia was provoked into attacking its neighbor by the eastward expansion of NATO under U.S. direction, even though Russian President Vladimir Putin has not listed that as his primary motive for invading. China has abstained in votes at the United Nations condemning Russia's actions, and, in keeping with standard policy, has strongly opposed economic sanctions against Russia. At the same time, China shows no signs of undermining those sanctions or rushing in to fill the void left by the departure of Western companies from Russia. Beijing has of late focused its messages on calls for talks leading to a cease-fire and avoiding a major humanitarian catastrophe. It has also provided Ukraine with humanitarian assistance and kept a line open to Ukrainian officials. Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Monday that China does not “have the mentality of watching the fire from a safe distance, still less to do anything that adds fuel to the fire."" WHAT'S BEHIND CHINA'S SUPPORT FOR RUSSIA? China and Russia have grown increasingly close under Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, aligning their foreign policies in opposition to the Western liberal world order. China generally follows Russia's lead in voting at the U.N. and has helped stymy efforts to censure it over its military intervention in Syria. Together, the countries account for two of the five permanent veto-wielding seats on the U.N. Security Council, forming a bloc that can effectively frustrate Washington's initiatives. The two are also closely linked economically, with China becoming Russia's largest trading partner and an important export market for its natural gas and oil. Just weeks before the war began, Xi and Putin met in Beijing and issued a joint statement describing their relations as having “no limits."" To criticize Putin would therefore implicitly criticize Xi, something China does not tolerate. WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS? By claiming to be an impartial observer, China has won Moscow's gratitude while largely shielding itself from obligations to take action against Russia. Beijing also points to the refusal of other countries including India and Brazil to condemn Moscow as evidence it doesn't stand alone. Beijing has no desire to see the end of Putin's regime, but could benefit from a weakened Russia becoming even more of a junior partner in the relationship. That could give Beijing a stronger hand in obtaining Russian energy resources and cutting edge military technology. At present, the risks are minimal. Beijing is long accustomed to being accused of enabling or perpetrating human rights abuses and has grown adept at ignoring or parrying them using its economic and political clout. While its biggest city Shanghai is facing one of the country's largest outbreak since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with a key Communist Party congress coming up later in the year, China is on high alert for anything that might threaten domestic stability. HOW IS CHINA KEEPING THE PUBLIC ON ITS SIDE? Beijing's entirely Communist Party-controlled media have reported on the civilian killings in Bucha, but their coverage has a strong pro-Russian slant. The media have also amplified Russian disinformation, especially debunked claims that the U.S. and Ukraine have been collaborating on the production of biological weapons. Beijing has sent instructions to teachers on how to “correctly” explain the conflict to students, with the U.S. cast as the “main culprit."" It's also shored up the official narrative with the circulation of a documentary film predating the Feb. 24 invasion that decries the fall of Russia's former communist system. “Historical Nihilism and the Soviet Collapse"" heaps praise on Putin and Joseph Stalin, while accusing reformers such as Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev of aiding the U.S. and its allies in weakening the system from within.",0
"As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, NATO planners went into overdrive On Location: April 8, 2022 UEDEM, Germany -- As Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine accelerated early this year, military planners at NATO began preparing to dispatch scores of fighter jets and surveillance aircraft into the skies near Russia and Ukraine. It was a warning to Moscow not to make the mistake of targeting any member country. Even in the weeks preceding the war, politicians and analysts were divided over whether President Vladimir Putin would really order Russian troops to invade. From a military point of view, though, the forces arrayed around Ukraine appeared designed to do just that. It became a matter of urgency to put more eyes in the sky and to tightly link NATO aircraft, warships, ground-based missile systems and radar installations to protect the alliance’s eastern flank. “We are monitoring very closely,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this week. “Information, best possible situation awareness, is of course extremely critical in such a dangerous situation as we see in Ukraine now.” In the lead-up to the Feb. 24 invasion, the alliance’s Combined Air Operations Center in Uedem, western Germany, shifted gear. A few dozen military personnel now simultaneously manage up to 30 aircraft in skies from the northern tip of Norway down to Slovakia. From an underground bunker in quiet farmland, patrolling aircraft are diverted to monitor suspicious Russian planes. Jets on 15-minute standby are routinely “Alpha Scrambled” from around Europe to intercept unidentified aircraft near NATO airspace. More than 100 aircraft can be working aloft on any given day, mixed in among roughly 30,000 civilian flights made daily through European skies. Six Boeing E-3A surveillance planes from NATO’s ageing fleet of early warning and control aircraft help create an “air picture” to share with member nations. These “eyes in the sky” do not fly into Ukraine or Russia, but can see up to 400 kilometers (250 miles) across borders. Fighter jets also provide information about what is going on inside part of two countries at war. These “assets” are sometimes sent from as far away as western France, refueled mid-air, and can patrol for about an hour in the border area before they must return. The 30-nation military alliance is wary of being drawn into a wider war with Russia, so borders and airspace are scrupulously respected. “There is always the fog of war, and we don’t want to have NATO assets close by because even unintentionally you might have some losses,” said Major General Harold Van Pee, commander of the NATO facility in Uedem. The most sensitive zones for unidentified planes are the Kola Peninsula — at the high north borders of Russia and Norway — the Gulf of Finland approaching the Russian city of St. Petersburg, and the skies around Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad, sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland. From their computer screens, NATO personnel can also track cruise missiles, like those that Russia used last month to pound a military training base in western Ukraine near NATO member Poland, killing 35 people. But shadowing them with aircraft is a high-risk endeavor, particularly at night, in poor weather or when the missiles hug the ground, flying so low that electrical pylons and cables become a danger. “We have to be convinced that there is a credible threat” to go after one, Van Pee said. A less obvious challenge to NATO airspace is rogue drones. Military officers said that Russia is using powerful electromagnetic devices for communication jamming purposes which can disrupt remotely controlled flights. Last month, a military drone drifted uncontrolled out of Ukraine through the airspace of three members – Romania, Hungary and Croatia – before crashing in the Croatian capital. Some parked cars were damaged but no one was hurt. The drone weighed just over 6 tons. Both Russia and Ukraine denied launching it. Military officers and NATO officials refuse to comment on the incident until an investigation is completed. “Even if you fly alongside one of those drones, are you going to do something about it? You have to ask yourself, because if you shoot it down then for sure you’re going to do damage on the ground. If you let it fly, hopefully it will crash in the sea. I mean, you don’t know,” Van Pee said. Whether it’s a rogue drone or a missile threat, political and legal experts are supposed to be involved in any decision to shoot something down. Despite the war in its backyard, NATO is operating under strict peacetime rules and is determined to keep it that way. “Before you start using force there has to be an imminent threat to either NATO forces or NATO populations. That’s a judgement call, and that’s always hard to make,” Van Pee said. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",5
"LIVE UPDATES Russia hopes to recruit upwards of 60,000 new troops, according to the U.S. On Location: April 8, 2022 Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""special military operation"" into neighboring Ukraine began on Feb. 24, with Russian troops invading from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east. Russian forces have since been met with ""stiff resistance"" from Ukrainians, according to U.S. officials. In recent days, Russian forces have retreated from northern Ukraine, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. After graphic images emerged of civilians lying dead in the streets of Bucha, a town northwest of Kyiv, the United States and European countries accused Russia of committing war crimes. For previous coverage, please click here. European Union President Ursula Von der Leyen was seen on camera witnessing a mass grave in Bucha, Ukraine, during a visit to the demolished city with the EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell and Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. After touring Bucha, Von der Leyen met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and handed him an envelope with a questionnaire, marking the first step toward membership in the EU. Zelenskyy said he'd have responses in one week. Global officials have accused Russian troops of committing war crimes after graphic images emerged of civilians lying dead in the streets of Bucha following the withdrawal of Russian forces. At a press conference Thursday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, ""The sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine have only strengthened our collective resolve and unity."" The Pentagon is ""not buying"" Russia's denial of responsibility for the Ukraine train station attack that killed at least 50, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. ""They originally claimed a successful strike and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties,"" the official said. ""It's our full expectation that this was a Russian strike -- we believe they used a short-range ballistic missile, an SS-21."" As Russian troops retreat from some Ukrainian cities, some of the Russian battalion tactical groups (or BTGs, with roughly 800-1,000 troops each) that have withdrawn back across the Belarusian and Russian borders have been essentially ""eradicated"" from the fighting in Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""There's just nothing left of the BTG except a handful of troops and maybe a small number of vehicles,"" the official said. In terms of total losses -- counting troops, tanks, aircraft and missile inventory -- Russia has lost between 15-20% of the combat power it originally had arrayed against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, according to the official. According to the official, some of the withdrawn Russian forces are now making their way to the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki, to the northwest of Donbas. But there are ""no indications"" that fresh troops are waiting there to join them, the official said. For now, degraded Russian BTGs are ""exploring the option of"" consolidating, banding together remaining troops and supplies to form new units, the official said. Russia is also aiming to recruit upwards of 60,000 new troops, according to the official. After Russian BTGs rebuild, ""the most likely course of action would be for them to move immediately south right into the Donbas,"" the official said. The Pentagon now estimates more than 40 Russian BTGs are positioned in or near the Donbas region. The estimate was ""more than 30"" on Wednesday, meaning up to 10,000 more troops have arrived in recent days. -ABC News' Matt Seyler Jalina Porter, the State Department's deputy spokesperson, is responding to the Russian attack at a Ukraine train station that killed at least 50, saying, ""We can no longer be surprised by the Kremlin's repugnant disregard for human life."" Five children were among those killed when Russian rockets struck the station in Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Friday morning, according to Ukraine's state-owned railway company. At least 100 people were injured, according to Donetsk Oblast Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko. Russia has denied involvement in the attack, which occurred as ""thousands"" of civilians fleeing the Russian invasion were at the train station waiting to be taken to ""safer regions of Ukraine,"" according to Kyrylenko. ""Civilians are killed when they stay in their homes, and they're killed when they try to leave,"" Porter said. ""Actions like these demonstrate why Russia did not belong on the U.N. Human Rights Council, and they also reinforce the U.S. assessment that members of Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine."" Porter declined to say if the department considers the train station attack a war crime, saying, ""Assessing individual criminal liability in specific cases is the responsibility of courts, as well as other investigatory bodies. But as the secretary, Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, has said, 'Those responsible for war crimes and other atrocities committed in Ukraine will be held to account.'"" -ABC News' Conor Finnegan At least 50 people, including five children, were killed in a rocket attack on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Friday, authorities said. Two Russian rockets struck the train station in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Friday morning, according to Ukraine's state-owned railway company, which in a statement via Facebook called the attack ""a purposeful strike on the passenger infrastructure of the railway and the residents of the city of Kramatorsk."" Donetsk Oblast Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said 38 of the 50 killed died at the scene while 12 died in hospitals. At least 100 were injured, according to the governor. The attack occurred as ""thousands"" of civilians fleeing the Russian invasion were at the train station waiting to be taken to ""safer regions of Ukraine,"" according to Kyrylenko, who accused Russian forces of ""deliberately trying to disrupt the evacuation of civilians."" ""The evacuation will continue,"" the governor added. ""Anyone who wants to leave the region will be able to do so."" Graphic images provided by Ukrainian officials showed the aftermath of the attack -- bodies lying on the ground next to scattered luggage and debris, with charred vehicles parked nearby. The remains of a large rocket with the words ""for our children"" in Russian painted on the side was also seen on the ground next to the main building of the station. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement via Facebook that a Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile was used in Friday's attack. Earlier this week, large crowds of people were seen waiting on the platform to board trains at the Kramatorsk railway station as they fled the city in Ukraine's disputed Donbas region. Since 2014, Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the Donbas. The separatists have been fighting alongside Russian troops to seize more territory there, after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Now, the Russian military is said to be refocusing its offensive in the Donbas as its troops withdraw from northern Ukraine.",8

""Our Armed Forces do not use missiles of this type,"" Peskov told reporters during a press briefing Friday. ""No combat tasks were set or planned for today in Kramatorsk."" According to a senior U.S. defense official, the initial assessment by the U.S. is this was a short-range ballistic missile fired by Russian forces from inside Ukraine.

Nate Mook, CEO of Chef José Andrés' World Central Kitchen, told CNN he was near the train station picking up supplies when the station was hit. He said he saw thousands of women, children and elderly waiting for a train, and less than two minutes later, he heard five to 10 booms. Mook tweeted, ""Innocent women & children were murdered here today."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the attack ""yet another horrific atrocity"" but stopped short of calling it a war crime without further investigation. ""Obviously the targeting of civilians would certainly be a war crime and we've already called a range of the actions we have seen to date a war crime, but we're going to be supporting efforts to investigate exactly what happened here,"" she said. Psaki also said that although the sanctions package announced Wednesday was ""augmented as a result of the atrocities"" seen in Bucha, the administration would assess how this new attack would impact additional sanctions. ""What we have done to date and will continue to do is look at, unfortunately, the continued atrocities that we're seeing in the country and assess how that's going to impact sanctions, consequences, and obviously additional security assistance,"" she said. ""And I'm certain given the video footage we have seen and on air waves across the world, and photos, that this will be a part of the discussion that our national security officials are having with their counterparts moving forward.""

"The vice president asked Ralph Warnock and Cory Booker to capture the moment. Who is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson? As she presided over Thursday's historic confirmation vote for Ketanji Brown Jackson to become the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court, Vice President Kamala Harris gave an assignment to Sens. Raphael Warnock and Cory Booker -- the only two Black Democrats in the Senate: Write a letter, using the vice president's official stationery, to a young Black girl in their lives. Before the vote, Warnock, speaking on the Senate floor, had spoken of the historic aspect of Judge Jackson's confirmation by talking about his own daughter. ""Yes I'm a Senator, I'm a pastor, beyond all of that I am a father of young Black girl. I know how much it means for Judge Jackson to have navigated the double jeopardy of racism and sexism to now stand in the glory of this moment, in all of her excellence,"" Warnock said. ""For my five-year-old daughter and for so many young women in our country, but really if we're thinking about it right for all of us, seeing Judge Jackson ascend to the Supreme Court reflect the promise of progress on which on democracy rests. So, what a great day it is in America,"" he said. Later, Warnock shared on Twitter ""Dear Chloé, Today, we confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court,"" he wrote.

"The motion picture academy has banned Will Smith from attending the Oscars or any other academy event for 10 years following his slap of Chris Rock at the Academy Awards LOS ANGELES -- The motion picture academy on Friday banned Will Smith from attending the Oscars or any other academy event for 10 years following his slap of Chris Rock at the Academy Awards. The move comes after a meeting of the academy's Board of Governors to discuss a response to Smith's actions. “The 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage,” the academy said in a statement. “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision,” Smith said in response. He pre-emptively resigned from the academy last week during the run-up to the meeting, calling his actions ""shocking, painful, and inexcusable.” Smith will keep the Oscar he won after the slap, and he will remain eligible to be nominated for and to win more of them in the 10-year period, though he can't show up to accept them. The academy also apologized for its handling of the situation and allowing Smith to stay and accept his best actor award for “King Richard.” “During our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room. For this, we are sorry,” the academy said. “This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short — unprepared for the unprecedented.” In a statement in the days following the Oscars, the academy said Smith was asked to leave the ceremony but refused. But it's not clear how the message was delivered to Smith or what form it took, and several media outlets reported that he was never formally told to leave the Dolby Theatre. The Los Angeles Times reported in a story Thursday that Oscars producer Will Packer told Smith: “Officially, we don’t want you to leave. We want you to stay.” The ban means Smith will not be presenting one of the major awards at next year's Oscars, as is tradition for the best actor winner. The academy in its Friday statement also expressed “deep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances.” The academy has not revoked Oscars from expelled members Harvey Weinstein or Roman Polanski. With his resignation last week, Smith lost the ability to vote for nominees and winners. Smith has been nominated for four Oscars, winning once. At the March 27 Academy Awards, Rock came out to present the best documentary award and made jokes about several attendees, including Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. “Jada, I love you. ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it,” Rock said. Pinkett Smith, who has spoken publicly about her hair loss condition, alopecia, had a closely shaved head similar to that of Demi Moore in the 1997 movie. Smith strode from his front-row seat on to the stage and smacked Rock, stunning the comedian, the theater crowd and viewers at home. Many thought it was a planned gag set up by the show or the men themselves, but the seriousness of the situation set in after Smith returned to his seat and angrily twice shouted at Rock to “keep my wife’s name out your (expletive) mouth.” Rock said he had no interest in pursuing charges when asked by police backstage. Smith took the stage again less than hour later to accept his Oscar, tearfully apologizing to the academy but notably omitting any mention of Rock. He compared himself to Richard Williams, the man he played in “King Richard,” “a fierce defender of his family.” Later that night, Smith danced with his trophy and his family and rapped along with his own songs in celebration of his win at the Vanity Fair post-Oscars party. Rock has only briefly addressed the attack publicly, saying at one comedy concert in Boston this week that he was still “kind of processing what happened.” ——— Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton",4
"A milestone Supreme Court confirmation that endured a flawed process WASHINGTON -- A milestone Supreme Court confirmation that endured a flawed process. The collapse of a bipartisan compromise for more pandemic funds. The departure of a stalwart of the dwindling band of moderate House Republicans. Party-line fights on Capitol Hill are as old as the republic, and they routinely escalate as elections approach. Yet three events from a notable week illustrate how Congress' near- and long-term paths point toward intensifying partisanship. THE SENATE'S SUPREME COURT BATTLE Democrats rejoiced Thursday when the Senate by 53-47 confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black female justice. They crowed about a bipartisan stamp of approval from the trio of Republicans who supported it: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah. Yet by historical standards, the three opposition party votes were paltry and underscored the recent trend of Supreme Court confirmations becoming loyalty tests on party ideology. That's a departure from a decades-long norm when senators might dislike a nominee’s judicial philosophy but defer to a president's pick, barring a disqualifying revelation. Murkowski said her support for Jackson was partly “rejection of the corrosive politicization"" of how both parties consider Supreme Court nominations, which ""is growing worse and more detached from reality by the year.” Republicans said they would treat Jackson respectfully, and many did. Their questions and criticisms of her were pointed and partisan, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying “the Senate views itself as a co-partner in this process” with the president. Yet some potential 2024 GOP presidential contenders seemed to use Jackson’s confirmation to woo hard-right support. Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., misleadingly accused her of being unusually lenient on child pornography offenders. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., suggested she might have defended Nazis at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, before she was born. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said some Republicans “went overboard, as far as I’m concerned, to the extreme,” reflecting “the reality of politics on Capitol Hill.” Cotton was “fundamentally unfair, but that is his tradition,” said Durbin. SUPREME COURT BATTLES PAST Senate approval of high court nominees by voice vote, without bothering to hold roll calls, was standard for most of the 20th century. Conservative Antonin Scalia sailed into the Supreme Court by 98-0 in 1986, while liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg won 96-3 approval seven years later. There were bitter fights. Democrats blocked conservative Robert Bork’s nomination in 1987 and unsuccessfully opposed Clarence Thomas’ ascension in 1991 after he was accused of sexual harassment. Hard feelings intensified in early 2016. McConnell, then majority leader, blocked the Senate from even considering President Barack Obama's pick of Merrick Garland to replace the deceased Scalia. McConnell cited the presidential election nearly nine months away, infuriating Democrats. Donald Trump was elected and ultimately filled three vacancies over near-unanimous Democratic opposition. Democrats opposed Brett Kavanaugh after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman decades earlier, which he denied. They voted solidly against Amy Coney Barrett after Trump and McConnell rushed through her nomination when a vacancy occurred just weeks before Election Day 2020, a sprint Democrats called hypocritical. COVID SPENDING FIGHT, TRANSFORMED Senators from both parties agreed to a $10 billion COVID-19 package Monday that President Joe Biden wants for more therapeutics, vaccines and tests. With BA.2, the new omicron variant, washing across the country, it seemed poised for congressional approval. Hours later, bargainers led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, seemed blindsided when their compromise was derailed. Republicans wanted to add an extension of an expiring crackdown on migrants crossing the Mexican border that Trump imposed in 2020, citing the pandemic’s public health threat. Many Republicans were skeptical that more COVID-19 money was necessary. But their demand for an immigration amendment transformed a fight over how much more to spend on a disease that's killed 980,000 people in the U.S. into a battle over border security, tailor-made for GOP political campaigns ahead. Immigration divides Democrats, and Republicans believe the issue can further solidify their chances of winning congressional control in November’s elections. Playing defense, Schumer postponed debate on the COVID-19 bill. Democrats deserved some blame for being outmaneuvered. House Democrats shot down a $15 billion agreement in March, rejecting compromise budget savings to pay for it. And in glaringly tone-deaf political timing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced April 1, just as bargainers were completing their latest compromise, that the Trump-era immigration curbs would lapse May 23. That gave Republicans an irresistible political gift to pursue. A MODERATE'S FAREWELL Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., announced his retirement Tuesday. He's the fourth of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last year to say they won't seek reelection. Upton attributed his departure to running in a new district, but that didn't stop Trump from proclaiming: ""UPTON QUITS! 4 down and 6 to go.” The House impeached Trump over his incitement of supporters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but the GOP-run Senate acquitted him. Now in his 18th term, Upton's departure subtracts another moderate from a GOP that's shifted rightward in recent years, particularly when it comes to showing fealty to Trump. The pro-business Upton, 68, was a driving force on one law spurring pharmaceutical development and has worked with Democrats on legislation affecting energy and the auto industry. His bipartisan work and affability placed him in the ever-smaller group of Republicans who draw Democrats' praise. “To him, bipartisan and compromise are not forbidden words,"" said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich. PARTY DIFFERENCES, THEN AND NOW Pitched battles are now habitual over bills financing federal agencies and extending the government’s borrowing authority. When those disputes are resolved and federal shutdowns and defaults averted, lawmakers hail as triumphs what is their most rudimentary task — keeping government functioning. Despite the divisions over COVID-19 money and Jackson, there has also been cooperation. Congress overwhelmingly voted Thursday to ban Russian oil and downgrade trade relations with that country following its invasion of Ukraine. There’s progress on bipartisan trade and technology legislation, and a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure measure became law last year.",9
"Civilian evacuations are moving forward in patches of battle-scarred eastern Ukraine a day after a missile strike killed at least 52 people at a train station where thousands were waiting to leave before an expected Russian onslaught KYIV, Ukraine -- Civilian evacuations moved forward in patches of battle-scarred eastern Ukraine on Saturday, a day after a missile strike killed at least 52 people and wounded more than 100 at a train station where thousands clamored to leave before an expected Russian onslaught. In the wake of the attack in Kramatorsk, several European leaders made efforts to show solidarity with Ukraine, with the Austrian chancellor and British prime minister visiting Kyiv — the capital city that Russia failed to capture and where troops retreated days ago. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where Johnson's office said they discussed Britan's “long-term support.” Ukrainian authorities have called on civilians to get out ahead of an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the east. With trains not running out of Kramatorsk on Saturday, panicked residents boarded buses or looked for other ways to leave, fearing the kind of unrelenting assaults and occupations by Russian invaders that delivered food shortages, demolished buildings and death to other cities elsewhere in Ukraine. “It was terrifying. The horror, the horror,"" one resident told British broadcaster Sky, recalling Friday's attack. ""Heaven forbid, to live through this again. No, I don’t want to.” Ukraine’s state railway company said in a statement that residents of Kramatorsk and other parts of the country’s contested Donbas region could flee through other train stations. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 10 evacuation corridors were planned for Saturday. More than six weeks after Russia first invaded Ukraine, it has pulled its troops from the northern part of the country, around Kyiv, and refocused on the Donbas region in the east. Western military analysts said an arc of territory in eastern Ukraine was under Russian control, from Kharkiv — Ukraine’s second-largest city — in the north to Kherson in the south. But Ukrainian counterattacks are threatening Russian control of Kherson, according to the Western assessments, and Ukrainian forces are repelling Russian assaults elsewhere in the Donbas region in the southeast. Zelenskyy called the train station attack the latest example of war crimes by Russian forces and said it should motivate the West to do more to help his country defend itself. “All world efforts will be directed to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address, his voice rising in anger. Russia denied it was responsible and accused Ukraine’s military of firing on the station to turn blame for civilian casualties on Moscow. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman detailed the missile’s trajectory and Ukrainian troop positions to bolster the argument. Western experts and Ukrainian authorities insisted that Russia launched the weapon. Remnants of the rocket had the words “For the children” in Russian painted on it. The phrasing seemed to suggest the missile was sent to avenge the loss or subjugation of children, although its exact meaning remained unclear. Western experts dismissed Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov’s assertion that Russian forces “do not use” Tochka-U missiles, the type that hit the Kramatorsk train station, which is in Ukrainian government-controlled territory in the Donbas. The attack came as Ukrainian authorities worked to identify victims and document possible war crimes by Russian soldiers in northern Ukraine. The mayor of Bucha, a town near Kyiv where graphic evidence of civilian slayings emerged after the Russians withdrew, said search teams were still finding the bodies of people shot at close range in yards, parks and city squares. On Friday, workers unearthed the bodies of 67 people from a mass grave near a church, according to Ukraine's prosecutor general. Russia has falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged. Ukrainian authorities and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of committing atrocities in the war that began with Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. A total of 176 children have been killed, while 324 more have been wounded, the country’s Prosecutor General’s Office said Saturday. In an excerpted interview with American broadcaster CBS’ “60 Minutes” that aired Friday, Zelenskyy cited communications intercepted by the Ukrainian security service as evidence of Russian war crimes. The authenticity of the recordings could not be independently verified. “There are (Russian) soldiers talking with their parents about what they stole and who they abducted. There are recordings of (Russian) prisoners of war who admitted to killing people,” he said. “There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. There are also investigations being conducted based on the remains of the dead.” Ukrainian authorities have warned they expect to find more mass killings once they reach the southern port city of Mariupol, which is also in the Donbas and has been subjected to a monthlong blockade and intense fighting. As journalists who had been largely absent from the city began to trickle back in, new images emerged of the devastation from an airstrike on a theater last month that reportedly killed hundreds of civilians seeking shelter. Military analysts had predicted for weeks that Russia would succeed in taking Mariupol but said Ukrainian defenders were still putting up a fight. The city's location on the Sea of Azov is critical to establishing a land bridge from the Crimean Peninula, which Russia seized from Ukraine eight years ago. Many civilians now trying to evacuate are accustomed to living in or near a war zone because Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014 in the Donbas. The same week Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of areas controlled by the separatists and said he planned to send troops in to protect residents of the mostly Russian-speaking, industrial region. Ukrainian officials have pleaded with Western powers almost daily to send more arms, and to further punish Russia with sanctions, including the exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system and a total European Union embargo on Russian gas and oil. The deaths of civilians at the train station brought renewed expressions of outrage from Western leaders and pledges that Russia would face further reprisals for its actions in Ukraine. On Saturday, Russia’s Defense Ministry tried to counter the dominant international narrative by again raising the specter of Ukraine planting false flags and misinformation. A ministry spokesman, Major Gen. Igor Konashenkov, alleged Ukraine’s security services were preparing a “cynical staged” media operation in Irpin, another town near Kyiv. Konashenkov said the plan was to show -- falsely, he said -- more civilian casualties at the hands of the Russians and to stage the slaying of a fake Russian intelligence team that intended to kill witnesses. The claims could not be independently verified. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said during a visit to Kyiv on Saturday that he expects more EU sanctions against Russia, but he defended his country’s opposition so far to cutting off deliveries of Russian gas. A package of sanctions imposed this week “won’t be the last one,” the chancellor said, acknowledging that “as long as people are dying, every sanction is still insufficient.” Austria is militarily neutral and not a member of NATO. Johnson's visit, which was not announced in advance, came a day after the U.K. pledged an additional 100 million pounds ($130 million) in high grade military equipment to Ukraine. ——— Anna reported from Bucha, Ukraine.

"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer have joined a stream of European leaders showing their support for Ukraine LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Saturday joined the stream of European leaders showing their support for Ukraine by traveling to the nation’s capital for face-to-face meetings with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Johnson’s surprise visit included a pledge of new military assistance, including 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems. This came a day after he promised to send an additional 100 million pounds ($130 million) of high-grade military equipment to Ukraine, saying Britain wanted to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. Johnson also confirmed further economic support, guaranteeing an additional $500 million in World Bank lending to Ukraine, taking Britain's total loan guarantee to up to $1 billion. “Today I met my friend President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv as a show of our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine,'' Johnson said on Twitter. “We’re setting out a new package of financial & military aid which is a testament of our commitment to his country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign.'' The head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said “the conversation was rich and constructive,” but offered no details. An image of the two leaders meeting was posted online by the Ukrainian Embassy in London with the headline: “Surprise,” and a winking smiley face. The package of military aid Britain announced Friday includes more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, another 800 anti-tank missiles and precision munitions capable of lingering in the sky until directed to their target. “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century,? Johnson said in a statement. “It is because of President Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted.'' As Zelenskyy makes a continuous round of virtual appearances to drum up support from lawmakers around the world, an increasing number of European leaders have decided the time is right to travel to Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, for in-person talks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was in Kyiv on Friday, following earlier visits from the Czech, Polish and Slovenian prime ministers. Nehammer met with Zelenskyy earlier Saturday and pledged that the EU would continue to ratchet up sanctions against Russia “until the war stops.” “As long as people are dying, every sanction is still insufficient,” he said, adding that Austrian embassy staff will return to Kyiv from western Ukraine. Von der Leyen, who heads the European Union’s executive branch, travelled to Warsaw on Saturday to lead a fundraising event for Ukraine. She was joined by Polish President Andrzej Duda, with Zelenskyy and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appearing by video link. At the end of the 90-minute meeting, von der Leyen said 10.1 billion euros ($11 billion) had been raised for Ukrainian refugees. The event was held in Warsaw because more than 2.5 million of the 4.4 million people who have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began Feb. 24 have entered Poland. Many have stayed, though some have moved on to other countries. Convened jointly by von der Leyen and Trudeau, the event sought to attract pledges from governments, global celebrities and average citizens. It ended with Julian Lennon singing his father John Lennon’s peace song “Imagine,"" which he said is the first time he did so publicly. Julian Lennon posted on social media that he always said he would only sing the song if it was the “end of the world.” He says it’s the right song to sing now because “the war on Ukraine is an unimaginable tragedy,” and he felt compelled to respond in the most significant way that he could. ——— Associated Press Writers Colleen Barry in Milan, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Monika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed. ——— Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",3
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia is targeting all of Europe with its aggression, and that stopping the invasion of Ukraine is essential for the security of all democracies KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia is targeting all of Europe with its invasion of Ukraine, and stopping Moscow's aggression is essential for the security of all democracies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said as Russian forces prepared for battle in the east of his country. Addressing the “free people of a brave country,"" Zelenskyy said in a late night video message to Ukrainians that Russia's war aim “was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone” and the “entire European project is a target.” “That is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe, to support Ukraine’s desire for peace,"" he said. ”This is, in fact, a strategy of defense for every civilized state."" His address came as civilians continued to flee eastern parts of the country before an expected onslaught and emergency workers searched for survivors in towns north of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, that are no longer occupied by Russian forces. Russia has pulled its troops from the northern part of the country and refocused on the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years and controlled some territory before the war, now in its 46th day. Western military analysts said an arc of territory in eastern Ukraine was under assault, from Kharkiv — Ukraine’s second-largest city — in the north to Kherson in the south. Newly released Maxar Technologies satellite imagery collected Friday showed an 8-mile (13-kilometer) convoy of military vehicles headed south to the Donbas through the town of Velykyi Burluk. However, Western assessments expressed increasing confidence in the ability of Ukraine's defenders to repel Russian assaults, portraying Russia's troops as suffering from low morale and mounting casualties. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that the Russian military was seeking to respond to mounting losses by boosting troop numbers with personnel who have been discharged from military service since 2012. In an update on Twitter, the ministry also said that the Russian military’s efforts to “generate more fighting power” also include trying to recruit from Trans-Dniester, a breakaway region in Moldova that borders Ukraine. Russia-backed separatists in eastern Moldova took up arms in 1992 to establish Trans-Dniester, which is not internationally recognized and where Russia maintains some 1,500 troops. Several European leaders have made efforts to show solidarity with battle-scarred Ukraine. In his video address, Zelenskyy thanked the leaders of Britain and Austria for their visits to Kyiv on Saturday and pledges of further support. He also thanked the European Commission president and Canada's prime minister for a global fundraising event that brought in more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) for the millions of Ukrainians who have fled their homes. Zelenskyy repeated his call for a complete embargo on Russian oil and gas, which he called the sources of Russia’s “self-confidence and impunity.” Some European countries depend heavily on imported Russian energy. “Freedom does not have time to wait,” Zelenskyy said. ""When tyranny begins its aggression against everything that keeps the peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately."" In an interview with The Associated Press inside his heavily guarded presidential office complex, Zelenskyy said he was committed to negotiating a diplomatic end to the war even though Russia has “tortured” Ukraine. He also acknowledged that peace likely will not come quickly. Talks so far have not included Russian President Vladimir Putin or other top officials. “We have to fight, but fight for life. You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war,” the president said. Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia forces of commiting war crimes against thousands of civilians during the invasion, including airstrikes on hospitals, a missile attack that killed 52 people at a train station Friday and shooting residents of towns in the north at close range. Graphic evidence of civilian slayings emerged after Russian forces withdrew from Bucha, and firefighters were searching buildings in Borodyanka, another settlement outside Kyiv. Russia has denied engaging in war crimes and falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged. Ukrainian authorities have said they expect to find more mass killings once they reach the southern port city of Mariupol, which is also in the Donbas and has been subjected to a monthlong blockade and intense fighting. The city’s location on the Sea of Azov is critical to establishing a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine eight years ago. Ukrainian officials have pleaded with Western powers almost daily to send more arms and further punish Moscow with sanctions, including the exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system and a total EU embargo on Russian gas and oil. During his visit Saturday, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he expects more EU sanctions against Russia, but defended his country’s opposition so far to cutting off deliveries of Russian gas. A package of sanctions imposed this week “won’t be the last one,” the chancellor said, acknowledging that “as long as people are dying, every sanction is still insufficient.” Austria is militarily neutral and not a member of NATO. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's visit came a day after the U.K. pledged an additional 100 million pounds ($130 million) in high-grade military equipment. Johnson also confirmed further economic support, guaranteeing an additional $500 million in World Bank lending to Ukraine, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee to up to $1 billion. In the interview with AP, Zelenskyy noted the increased support but expressed frustration when asked if weapons and equipment Ukraine has received from the West is sufficient to shift the war’s outcome. “Not yet,” he said, switching to English for emphasis. “Of course it’s not enough.” ——— Anna reported from Bucha, Ukraine.

"Blame for ""war crimes and atrocities...lies at the feet of the Kremlin.""  War crimes and atrocities in Ukraine 'lie at the feet' of the Kremlin: Sullivan National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the latest reports of Ukrainian civilians being tortured and killed by Russian troops have been ""horrifying...downright shocking, but they have not been surprising."" Sullivan told ABC News ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday that before the war began, declassified intelligence ""indicated that there was a plan from the highest levels of the Russian government to target civilians who oppose the invasion."" ""So this is something that was planned,"" he told Karl, adding that some units may have acted without direction from their leaders, frustrated by the level of opposition they've encountered from Ukrainians. ""I do think some of these units engaged in these acts of brutality, these atrocities, these war crimes, even without direction from above. But make no mistake, the larger issue of broad-scale war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine lies at the feet of the Kremlin and lies at the feet of the Russian president,"" he said. When asked if the acts amounted to genocide as suggested by United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv this week, Sullivan noted that the State Department usually makes that legal determination after an investigation and legal analysis. ""But let's set legalities aside for a minute...I think we can all say that these are mass atrocities. These are war crimes,"" he said. In one of the latest incidents, at least 52 people, including five children, were killed during a missile strike at a train station in eastern Ukraine. Images of bodies strewn across luggage showed the magnitude of the attack, which injured at least 100. Since the war began, the Biden administration has been steadily implementing sanctions meant to cripple the Russian economy and Putin's funding of the invasion. In the latest package, the U.S., in conjunction with its European Union and G-7 allies, imposed a ban on all new investments in Russia, increased sanctions on two major banks and sanctioned Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. But while the U.S. has banned Russian oil imports, European governments have not. Asked if it was time for Europe to ban Russian oil and gas and imports, which come to an estimated $850 million per day, Sullivan said the president had been clear that the U.S. was able to do so ""without imposing massive costs on the American people"" but would continue to work with European allies to limit dependency. ""He is now working on a daily basis with his European colleagues on steps Europe can take to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas,"" he told Karl. ""In fact, the United States is surging gas exports to Europe in order for them to reduce their dependence on Russia."" Karl followed up: ""But you hear the frustration from President Zelenskyy. We heard it from the mayor of Kyiv that the money continues to flow, that the ruble is not in rubble as the president said...The money is still flowing and flowing in pretty dramatic levels."" ""If you look at independent projections of the Russian economy, it is likely to fall by something like 10 to 15% this year,"" Sullivan said. ""It is likely to cease to be one of the world's major economies because of the economic pressure we have put on them."" Sullivan also said the economy is being ""artificially propped up"" by Russian banks. ""Banks…are not allowed by the Russian government to sell dollars to customers. That's how they're protecting the ruble. But that has huge economic costs on the -- on the Russian economy,"" he added. ""We will continue to squeeze the Russian economy so that Russia and the Kremlin feel the pain from what they have done in Ukraine."" Sullivan conceded that although Putin has suffered several setbacks in his mission to topple the Ukrainian government, his tight grip on media has prevented Russians from hearing the truth. ""They are not getting the truth, for example, Jon, about the fact that the Russians lost and the Ukrainians won the battle for Kyiv,"" he said. ""Kyiv stands despite Russia's effort to conquer the capital city of their neighbor and they were unable to do that, and they suffered a significant military defeat there.""",0
"Russia has tapped a new Ukraine war commander to take centralized control of the next phase of battle after its costly failures in the opening campaign and carnage for Ukrainian civilians WASHINGTON -- Russia has tapped a new Ukraine war commander to take centralized control of the next phase of battle after its costly failures in the opening campaign and carnage for Ukrainian civilians. U.S. officials don't see one man making a difference in Moscow's prospects. Russia turned to Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, 60, one of Russia’s most experienced military officers and — according to U.S. officials — a general with a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and other war theaters. Up to now, Russia had no central war commander on the ground. The general's appointment was confirmed by a senior U.S. official who not authorized to be identified and spoke on condition of anonymity. But the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said “no appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.” “This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians,” Sullivan said. “And the United States, as I said before, is determined to do all that we can to support Ukrainians as they resist him and they resist the forces that he commands.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki echoed that thought. “The reports we’re seeing of a change in military leadership and putting a general in charge who was responsible for the brutality and the atrocities we saw in Syria shows that there’s going to be a continuation of what we’ve already seen on the ground in Ukraine and that’s what we are expecting,” she said. The decision to establish new battlefield leadership comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a large and more focused push to expand Russian control in Ukraine's east and south, including the Donbas, and follows a failed opening bid in the north to conquer Kyiv, the capital. Dvornikov gained prominence while leading the Russian group of forces in Syria, where Moscow has waged a military campaign to shore up President Bashar Assad’s regime during a devastating civil war. Dvornikov is a career military officer and has steadily risen through the ranks after starting as a platoon commander in 1982. He fought during the second war in Chechnya and took several top positions before being placed in charge of the Russian troops in Syria in 2015. Under Dvornikov’s command, Russian forces in Syria were known for crushing dissent in part by destroying cities, lobbing artillery and dropping what were often crudely made barrel bombs in sustained attacks that have displaced millions of Syrian civilians. The United Nations says the more than decade-long war has killed more than 350,000 people. In 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Dvornikov the Hero of Russia medal, one of the country’s highest awards. Dvornikov has served as the commander of the Southern Military District since 2016. Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, a Syrian army defector, said Sunday that while the situation in Syria is different than in Ukraine because the Russian military was fighting insurgent groups and not Ukraine's professional army, he expects a similar “scorched-earth” strategy. Al-Bayoush said he believes the aim of naming Dvornikov as Ukraine war commander is to turn the war into “rapid battles” in several places at the same time. “I expected him to use the scorched earth policy that was used in Syria,"" al-Bayoush said, referring to Russian-backed attacks in Syria in which cities and towns were put under long sieges while being subjected to intense bombardment that left many people dead and caused wide destruction to infrastructure and residential areas. “He has very good experience in this policy.” “This commander is a war criminal,” al-Bayoush said by telephone from Turkey. Since Russia joined the war in Syria in September 2015, Assad’s forces have taken control of most of the country after being on the verge of collapse. The Russian air force carried out thousands of airstrikes since, helping Russian-backed Syrian troops take areas after fighters were forced to choose between an amnesty in return for dropping their arms or being taken by buses into rebel-held areas. The last major Russian-backed offensive in Syria lasted several months, until March 2020, when a truce was reached between Russia and Turkey, which supported rival sides. Sullivan on Sunday said the Russian general has a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and “we can expect more of the same"" in Ukraine. But he stressed that the U.S. strategy remains the same in supporting Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Our policy is unequivocal — that we will do whatever we can to help Ukraine succeed,” Sullivan said. “Which means that we need to keep giving them weapons so that they can make progress on the battlefield. And we need to keep giving them military support and strong economic sanctions to improve their position, their posture at the negotiating table."" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, meanwhile, spoke by video conference Sunday to a small number of Ukrainian troops in the U.S. who are now returning to their country. The group has been in the U.S. since last fall for military schooling and were given training on new drones the U.S. sent to Ukraine last week for the war with Russia. Austin thanked the Ukrainian troop members for their courage and service and pledged continued U.S. support and security aid, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. Kirby said the small group was given some advanced tactical training, including on the Switchblade armed “kamakazi” drones, as well as instruction on patrol craft operations, communications and maintenance. In an interview Saturday with The Associated Press, Zelenskyy acknowledged that despite his hopes for peace, he must be “realistic” about the prospects for a swift resolution given that negotiations have so far been limited to low-level talks that do not include Putin. Zelenskyy renewed his plea for more weapons before an expected surge in fighting in the country’s east. He said, with frustration in regards to supplies of weapons from the U.S. and other Western nations, “of course it’s not enough.” Sullivan spoke on CNN's “State of the Union” and NBC's “Meet the Press. Psaki spoke on ”Fox News Sunday."" ——— Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.",6
"Russian troops are amassing in eastern Ukraine. Russian offensive on the horizon in Ukraine LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that an attack from Russian forces in the east is looming. But he said Ukrainian troops are ready. ""Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Sunday. ""But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field."" After Russian forces invaded Ukraine from the north, east and south on Feb. 24, they quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, but ultimately failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and other major cities in the north. Russian forces were met with strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, despite weeks of relentless bombardment that decimated entire neighborhoods and claimed civilian lives. The Russian military announced on March 29 it would scale down activities in the north around Kyiv and Chernihiv and instead focus its efforts on the ""liberation"" of the contested Donbas region in the east, which is home to a mostly Russian-speaking population. Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhanks oblasts in Donbas since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The Russian troops that have retreated from northern and northeastern Ukraine in recent days are now resting and resupplying in neighboring Belarus and Russia, according to observers, who noted it could take weeks before those troops are redployed for a fresh attack in the east. ""At least some of these forces will be transferred to East Ukraine to fight in the Donbas,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update on April 8. ""Many of these forces will require significant replenishment before being ready to deploy further east with any mass redeployment from the north likely to take at least a week minimum."" Nevertheless, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that ""this is a crucial phase of the war."" ""In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,"" Stoltenberg said at a press conference on April 5. Satellite images collected on April 8 by Maxar Technologies show a large military convoy of hundreds of vehicles, including tanks, that extends for at least 8 miles, moving south through the eastern Ukrainian town of Velykyi Burluk, about 55 miles east of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and some 65 miles from the border with Russia. Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens in the east that this is their last chance to flee, as Russian forces are expected to push south from Kharkiv and north from Donetsk in an attempt to encircle the battle-hardened Ukrainain troops in Donbas. In an interview with The Associated Press published Saturday, Zelenskyy said his country holds a strong position in the east and at the negotiation table because it maintains control of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been under Russian bombardment for more than a month. Although Russian forces have failed to capture the strategic port to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea, artillery and air raids have largely reduced Mariupol to rubble and killed thousands of residents, according to local officials. ""Mariupol is the heart of this war today,"" Zelenskyy told the AP. ""The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position in the east of the country."" In his address on Sunday night, Zelenskyy said this coming ""week will be no less important than"" the previous ones. ""It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose,"" he said. ""I will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine.",3
"Russia is moving masses of troops, armor and artillery toward eastern Ukraine.  Putin names new military commander  The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 47: Russia's new invasion commander The U.S. assesses that Putin has appointed Gen. Alexander Dvornikov to lead the invasion effort. But the change in leadership can't erase the logistical and operational problems that have plagued Russian forces, according to the senior U.S. defense official. ""They have high challenges to surmount, and the choice of a general doesn't mean that they're poised for greater success,"" the official said. Dvornikov previously led Russian forces in the south of Ukraine. ""He was the commander of the southern military district. And in the early days and weeks of the conflict, the Russians did achieve more success in the south than they achieved certainly in the north. I have no idea that was a factor in his selection,"" the official said. The official noted that Russian efforts in the south are now largely stalled, with no progress against Mariupol since last week, and no success advancing on Mykolayiv. ""If Mr. Putin's decision to pick Dvornikov was because he had some success, it wasn't that much,"" the official said. New commander, same 'depravity and brutality' The official said it is unclear how Dvornikov's selection could affect the fighting, but said a pattern of brutality remains a constant. ""What is clear is that the Russians continue to sink to new lows of depravity and brutality, as we saw with the missile strike on the train station last week,"" the official said. The death and destruction in Mariupol is also a concern. ""We're all bracing for when the rest of the world gets to see what happens in Mariupol, what has happened. I think we're certainly bracing ourselves here for some for some potentially really, really horrible outcomes,"" the official said. Russians moving troops and supplies toward Donbas Some of the Russian units that withdrew from the northern Ukraine area are starting to move east toward the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki. A long convoy of Russian vehicles is beginning to head south to Donbas from that area. ""We believe that this line of vehicles that we talked about that are north of Izium came out of the Belgorod/Valuyki region, from there to the south,"" the official said. Last week, the official said the Pentagon assessed Russia would use that region to refit and resupply its battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that have been worn down by hard fighting near Kyiv and other areas of Ukraine. Some Russian units are too gutted to fight. ""At least in the grouping that we're aware of, it's not an insignificant number of their BTGs are combat ineffective. And what does that mean? It means a lot of things. It can mean that they don't have the manpower that they need to effectively conduct a mission, or it could be ammunition and supply. It could be vehicles, depending on what the BTG does -- not all of them are just infantry,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes the convoy is still north of Izyim and is an effort to reenforce and resupply their forces in Donbas with command and control elements, armored vehicles, and possibly helicopter and infantry support. Artillery is also a part of the reinforcement effort. ""We've seen evidence that the Russians are beginning to reinforce some of their positions southwest of Donetsk. They're doing that largely with artillery units,"" the official said. Military aid flowing to Ukraine by air and land Eight to 10 flights per day are bringing military supplies into the region, and ""near constant convoys on the ground"" are flowing materiel into Ukraine, the official said. U.S. intelligence assisting Ukraine In addition to providing support in the form of missiles, drones and small arms, the U.S. is also giving intel to assist Ukraine in the fight. ""We are providing good intelligence to the Ukrainians to help them with their self-defense,"" the official said. No evidence Russia took out Slovakian S-300 system in Ukraine While the Pentagon assesses Russia damaged airport infrastructure with an airstrike Sunday, there is no indication that any S-300 surface-to-air systems were destroyed, as Russia has claimed. ""We have no evidence to conclude that they destroyed an S-300 system and we have no evidence to conclude that it was in fact the Slovakian one,"" the official said. Slovakia recently gave its sole S-300 battery to Ukraine. US considering training more Ukrainians on new weapons A small group of Ukrainian troops in the U.S. for planned military training in the U.S. when Russia invaded their country just returned home Sunday. The Pentagon took advantage of their presence to train them on the explosive Switchblade drones the U.S. is sending to aid Ukraine. The official on Monday said the U.S. is looking into training more Ukrainians, possibly in the States. ""It kind of follows that the Ukrainians are busy right now and that they obviously will want as many hands on deck there ... to fight this war. But there's been no policy decision that I'm aware of that would prevent them from coming to the United States,"" the official said. But the Pentagon is considering several possibilities. ""As for additional training on systems like the Switchblade, we are reviewing and thinking about and considering a number of different options for how we could manage to get more Ukrainians trained on that system,"" the official said. ""It's a small number of systems as you know, but it's a new system that they're not familiar with.""",6
"Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer says he told Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine and raised the issue of “serious war crimes"" committed by Russian troops Ukraine’s military claims to have repelled at least 8 Russian attacks VIENNA -- Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Monday that he urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine and raised the issue of “serious war crimes” committed by the Russian military. Nehammer was the first European leader to meet Putin in Moscow since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine Feb. 24. In a statement released after the meeting, the Austrian chancellor said his primary message to Putin in the “very direct, open and tough"" talks was that “this war needs to end, because in war both sides can only lose.” Nehammer told Putin all those responsible for war crimes in the Ukrainian city of Bucha and elsewhere would be “held to account."" He also stressed the need to open humanitarian corridors so that civilians trapped in cities under attack can access basic supplies like food and water, according to his statement. The Austrian leader called the Moscow trip to Moscow his “duty” to exhaust every possibility for ending the violence in Ukraine, coming just two days after travelling to Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Nehammer said face-to-face talks to look “each other in the eye, discussing the horrors of war,” could have a greater impact over the long term. But he said he walked away from the meeting without much optimism for an end to the war any time soon. “It might be necessary to do it 100 times,” Nehammer said of the meeting. “But I think it's necessary to do it, so that peace reigns again and the people of Ukraine can live safely.” European Union-member Austria supported the 27-nation bloc’s sanctions against Russia, though it so far has opposed cutting off deliveries of Russian gas. The country is militarily neutral and is not a member of NATO. But Nehammer and other Austrian officials have been keen to stress that military neutrality does not mean moral neutrality. “We are militarily neutral, but have a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine,” Nehammer wrote on Twitter Sunday when announcing his trip to Moscow. “It must stop!” Nehammer said he told Putin the EU is “as united as it’s ever been” on the issue of sanctions, and that these will remain in place - and may even be strengthened - as long as Ukrainians continue to die. Earlier Monday, Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg said Nehammer decided to make the Moscow trip after meeting with Zelenskyy in Kyiv and following contacts with the leaders of Turkey, Germany and the European Union. Schallenberg said ahead of a meeting with his EU counterparts in Luxembourg that it was an effort to ""seize every chance to end the humanitarian hell"" in Ukraine. He added that “every voice that makes clear to President Putin what reality looks like outside the walls of Kremlin is not a wasted voice.”",6
"Several universities have also reinstated masking requirements. Northeast US sees increase in COVID-19 cases Philadelphia has become the first major U.S. city to reinstate its indoor mask mandate, following an increase in COVID-19 infections, in recent weeks. Beginning April 18, masks will be required in all indoor public spaces, including schools, child care settings, businesses, restaurants and government buildings. ""I sincerely wish we didn't have to do this again. I wish this pandemic was over just as much as any of you, but I am very worried about our vulnerable neighbors and loved ones. My hope that our actions today will slow the spread of COVID and help us avoid seeing our ERs, once again, gets so crowded, that people can't get timely care when they need it,"" Health Commissioner Cheryl Bettigole said during a press conference on Monday. The city will implement a one-week ""education period"" to ensure that all residents are made aware of the change in protocols. For now, however, there is no vaccine or testing requirement for establishments that serve food or beverages. Over the last week, new cases per capita have increased by more than 50%, and daily case rates have risen past 100, according to city data. However, overall, COVID-19 related hospitalizations remain low. ""We hope that by having folks masks up whenever they're in public indoor spaces, we can get ahead of the wave and keep it from reaching a peak like we saw in January with the omicron variant. If we could do that we can literally save the lives of vulnerable Philadelphians,"" Bettigole said. Bettigole said that at this time, there is no reason to ""panic or to avoid activities."" She stressed that the city remains open, but wearing masks will allow those activities to continue, while keeping all residents safe. ""If we start to see a different pattern than that of previous waves of the virus, we'll review our metrics to see if there are opportunities to be less restrictive,"" Bettigole added. Several colleges and universities have also moved to reinstate masking requirements, given the increasing number of students and staff testing positive on-campus. On Sunday, Columbia University in New York City announced it would require masks again in classrooms — a policy that is expected to last through the end of the semester. ""Continued caution in certain situations remains extremely important, particularly in indoor social settings when the vaccination status of attendees is unknown or uncertain,"" Donna Lynne, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, said in a statement. Between Apr. 4 and Apr. 10, 133 students have tested positive — the highest weekly total since mid-January, according to university data. Last week, Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., temporarily reinstated an indoor mask requirement for its main and medical campuses, after seeing a ""significant increase"" in COVID-19 cases on-campus. ""This increase is partly due to the impact of the BA.2 Omicron subvariant. BA.2 is now the dominant strain in the United States, including in DC and on our campuses,"" school officials wrote in a statement last week. ""These circumstances present a challenge, but we have learned to adjust our mitigation measures to respond to changing conditions throughout the pandemic. Another adjustment is needed now to curb transmission on campus."" In recent weeks, a flurry of positive COVID-19 infections has disrupted life in Washington, D.C., as many top officials and politicians have tested positive for the virus. American University, Johns Hopkins University, Rice University, have all also issued similar masking requirements. However, school officials reported that there have been no known cases of serious illness.",7
"Philadelphia has become the first major U.S. city to reinstate its indoor mask mandate after reporting a sharp increase in coronavirus infections Northeast US sees increase in COVID-19 cases PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia became the first major U.S. city to reinstate its indoor mask mandate on Monday after reporting a sharp increase in coronavirus infections, with the city's top health official saying she wanted to forestall a potential new wave driven by an omicron subvariant. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have risen more than 50% in 10 days, the threshold at which the city’s guidelines call for people to wear masks indoors, said Dr. Cheryl Bettigole, the health commissioner. Health officials believe the recent spike is being driven by the highly transmissible BA.2 subvariant of omicron, which has spread rapidly throughout Europe and Asia, and has become dominant in the U.S. in recent weeks. “If we fail to act now, knowing that every previous wave of infections has been followed by a wave of hospitalizations, and then a wave of deaths, it will be too late for many of our residents,” said Bettigole, noting about 750 Philadelphia residents died in the wintertime omicron outbreak. “This is our chance to get ahead of the pandemic, to put our masks on until we have more information about the severity of this new variant.” Health inspectors will begin enforcing the mask mandate at city businesses on April 18. Most states and cities dropped their masking requirements in February and early March following new guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that put less focus on case counts and more on hospital capacity. The CDC said at that time that with the virus in retreat, most Americans could safely take off their masks. Philadelphia ended its indoor mask mandate March 2, and Bettigole acknowledged “it was wonderful to feel that sense of normalcy again.” Confirmed cases have since risen to more than 140 per day — still a fraction of what Philadelphia saw at the height of the omicron surge — while only 46 patients are in the hospital with COVID-19. The CDC says community spread in Philadelphia remains low, a level at which the agency says that masking can be optional. The restaurant industry pushed back against the city's reimposed mask mandate, saying workers will bear the brunt of customer anger over the new rules. “This announcement is a major blow to thousands of small businesses and other operators in the city who were hoping this spring would be the start of recovery,” said Ben Fileccia, senior director of operations at the Pennsylvania Restaurant & Lodging Association. PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said Friday that while it expects some increased transmission in the northern U.S. over the next several weeks, hospital admissions have remained low and “our team advises against required masking given that hospital capacity is good.” Bettigole said requiring people to mask up will help restaurants and other businesses stay open, while a huge new wave of COVID-19 would keep customers at home. She said hospital capacity was just one factor that went into her decision to reinstate the mandate. “I sincerely wish we didn’t have to do this again,” Bettigole said. “But I am very worried about our vulnerable neighbors and loved ones.” In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has paused his push to unwind many of the city’s virus rules as cases have risen, opting for now to keep a mask mandate for 2 to 4-year-olds in city schools and preschools. But Adams, a Democrat who has said New Yorkers should not let the pandemic run their lives, has already lifted most other mask mandates and rules requiring proof of vaccination to dine in restaurants, work out at gyms or attend shows. Adams was asked at a virtual news conference Monday afternoon if he was considering reimposing the New York City mask mandate in light of Philadelphia’s decision. The mayor said he would listen to his team of medical doctors for their advice on whether to bring back any restrictions. Adams himself tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday. New York City is now averaging around 1,800 new cases per day, about three times higher than in early March when New York began easing rules. That does not include the many home tests that go unreported to health officials. The latest outbreak has struck many high-profile officials in Washington, including Cabinet members and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut. Some universities have reinstated mask mandates. D.C. health officials say they have no immediate plans to change virus protocols, but they reserve the right to change course down the road. ——— Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania.

"The U.N. children's agency says nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion Ukrainians rush to evacuate the east UNITED NATIONS -- Nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion, and the United Nations has verified the deaths of 142 youngsters, though the number is almost certainly much higher, the U.N. children’s agency said Monday. Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF’s emergency programs director who just returned from Ukraine, said having 4.8 million of Ukraine’s 7.5 million children displaced in such a short time is “quite incredible.” He said it is something he hadn’t before seen happen so quickly in 31 years of humanitarian work. “They have been forced to leave everything behind — their homes, their schools and, often, their family members,” he told the U.N. Security Council. “I have heard stories of the desperate steps parents are taking to get their children to safety, and children saddened that they are unable to get back to school.” Ukraine’s U.N. ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, claimed Russia has taken more than 121,000 children out of Ukraine and reportedly drafted a bill to simplify and accelerate adoption procedures for orphans and even those who have parents and other relatives. He said most of the children were removed from the besieged southern port city of Mariupol and taken to eastern Donetsk and then to the Russian city of Taganrog. Fontaine said UNICEF has heard the same reports, but added that “we don’t have yet the access that we need to have to be able to look and verify and see if we can assist.” He said that of Ukraine's displaced children, 2.8 million are in Ukraine and 2 million more are in other countries. At the same time, he said, nearly half the estimated 3.2 million children still in their homes in Ukraine “may be at risk of not having enough food,” with those in besieged cities like Mariupol facing the most dire situation. Fontaine said school closings are affecting the education of 5.7 million younger children and 1.5 million students in higher education. “Hundreds of schools and educational facilities have been attacked or used for military purposes,” he said. “Others are serving as shelters for civilians.” The council also heard from Sima Bahous, the executive director of the UN Women agency, who recently returned from Moldova, which is hosting an estimated 95,000 Ukrainian refugees. Bahous said her agency is increasingly hearing allegations of rape and sexual violence. She said Moldova’s government and border police are also very concerned at the risk of human trafficking, especially of young women and unaccompanied teenagers. “The combination of mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags,” she said. Ukraine’s ambassador said his country's prosecutor’s office is now investigating a case in the Kyiv region in which a Russia soldier is alleged to have killed a local resident and then repeatedly raped his wife in their home. He said the alleged perpetrator has been identified. Kyslytsya said the Prosecutor General’s Office, in cooperation with investigation agencies and health facilities, is also installing “a special mechanism” to document cases of sexual violence by Russian soldiers. The Security Council meeting on the impact of the war on women and children was convened by the U.S. and Albania during Britain’s presidency of the body. The three countries, Ukraine and other council members attacked Russia for creating the dire situation for women and children, which Russian deputy ambassador Dmitry Polyansky vehemently denied. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that when men like Russian President Vladimir Putin “start wars, women and children get displaced,” hurt, raped and abused, and they die. “Since the start of Russia’s unprovoked war against Ukraine, Russia has bombed orphanages and maternity hospitals,” she said. “We’ve seen mass graves with dead children stacked on top of each other.” Albanian Ambassador Ferit Hoxha accused Russia of committing “unspeakable crimes” every day, including burning civilians, throwing bodies in mass graves, shooting into playgrounds, attacking schools on purpose, and leaving all Ukrainians suffering, especially women and children. “In their normal life, children draw parents, houses and trees. Russia's war has made Ukraine kids draw bombs, tanks and weapons,” Hoxha said. Both the U.S. and Albanian ambassadors, and many others, pointed to the discovery of bodies, some with hands tied behind their backs, in the town of Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv following the withdrawal of Russian troops, and the missile that killed at least 52 mainly women and children at the train station in eastern Kramatorsk. Hoxha noted that the missile had “a vicious signature, `for our children.’” Russia's Polyansky blamed “Ukrainian Nazis” for civilian killings in Bucha and the bombing at the Kramatorsk station, which he called “a classic false flag operation.” He accused Ukraine and its public relations experts, along with the West, of promoting “fakes and propaganda” as part of “the information war unleashed against Russia.” “That war is as intense as the military operations on the ground,” he said. Lord Tariq Ahmad, Britain's minister of state for the U.N. who presided over the meeting, countered that Russia again was trying to deflect from the reality on the ground “by what can only be described as quite extraordinary statements, and even lies.” “Yet, what is true, what is fact, is that Russian attacks on civilians and residential areas have been truly barbaric,” he said.",6
"President Vladimir Putin has vowed that Russia’s bloody offensive in Ukraine would continue until its goals are fulfilled KYIV, Ukraine -- Vladimir Putin vowed Tuesday that Russia's bloody offensive in Ukraine would continue until its goals are fulfilled and insisted the campaign was going as planned, despite a major withdrawal in the face of stiff Ukrainian opposition and significant losses. Russian troops, thwarted in their push toward Ukraine's capital, are now focusing on the eastern Donbas region, where Ukraine said Tuesday it was investigating a claim that a poisonous substance had been dropped on its troops. It was not clear what the substance might be, but Western officials warned that any use of chemical weapons by Russia would be a serious escalation of the already devastating war. Russia invaded on Feb. 24, with the goal, according to Western officials, of taking Kyiv, toppling the government and installing a Moscow-friendly regime. In the six weeks since, Russia’s ground advance stalled, its forces lost potentially thousands of fighters and the military was accused of killing civilians and other atrocities. Putin insisted Tuesday that his invasion aimed to protect people in parts of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed rebels and to “ensure Russia’s own security.” He said Russia “had no other choice” but to launch what he calls a “special military operation,” and vowed it would “continue until its full completion and the fulfillment of the tasks that have been set.” For now, Putin's forces are gearing up for a major offensive in the Donbas, which has been torn by fighting between Russian-allied separatists and Ukrainian forces since 2014, and where Russia has recognized the separatists’ claims of independence. Military strategists say Russian leaders appear to hope local support, logistics and terrain in the region favor Russia’s larger and better-armed military, potentially allowing its troops to finally turn the tide in their favor. In Mariupol, a strategic port city in the Donbas, a Ukrainian regiment defending a steel mill claimed a drone dropped a poisonous substance on the city. It indicated there were no serious injuries. The assertion by the Azov Regiment, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian military, could not be independently verified. It came after a Russia-allied separatist official appeared to urge the use of chemical weapons, telling Russian state TV on Monday that separatist forces should seize the plant by first blocking all the exits. “And then we’ll use chemical troops to smoke them out of there,” the official, Eduard Basurin, said. He denied Tuesday that separatist forces had used chemical weapons in Mariupol. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said officials were investigating, and it was possible phosphorus munitions — which cause horrendous burns but are not classed as chemical weapons — had been used in Mariupol. Much of the city has been razed in weeks of pummeling by Russian troops. The mayor said Monday that the siege has left more than 10,000 civilians dead, their corpses “carpeted through the streets.” Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the death toll in Mariupol alone could surpass 20,000 and gave new details of allegations by Ukrainian officials that Russian forces have brought mobile cremation equipment to dispose of the corpses. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, acknowledged the challenges Ukrainian troops face in Mariupol. He said on Twitter that they remain blocked and are having issues with supplies, while Zelenskyy and Ukrainian generals “do everything possible (and impossible) to find a solution and help our guys.” “For more than 1.5 months our defenders protect the city from (Russian) troops, which are 10+ times larger,"" Podolyak said in a tweet. “They’re fighting under the bombs for each meter of the city. They make (Russia) pay an exorbitant price.” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the use of chemical weapons “would be a callous escalation in this conflict,” while Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said it would be a “wholesale breach of international law.” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the U.S. could not confirm the drone report. But he noted the administration’s persistent concerns “about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine.” Britain, meanwhile, has warned that Russia may resort to phosphorus bombs, which are banned in civilian areas under international law, in Mariupol. Most armies use phosphorus munitions to illuminate targets or to produce smoke screens. Deliberately firing them into an enclosed space to expose people to fumes could breach the Chemical Weapons Convention, said Marc-Michael Blum, a former laboratory head at the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. “Once you start using the properties of white phosphorus, toxic properties, specifically and deliberately, then it becomes banned,” he said. In the face of stiff resistance by Ukrainian forces bolstered by Western weapons, Russian forces have increasingly relied on bombarding cities, flattening many urban areas and leaving thousands of people dead. The war has also driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes — including nearly two-thirds of all children. Moscow's retreat from cities and towns around the capital, Kyiv, led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, prompting widespread condemnation and accusations that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine. Reports have primarily focused on the northwestern suburbs such as Bucha, where the mayor said 403 bodies have been found. Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk feared the toll would rise as minesweepers comb through the area. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general’s office said Tuesday that it was also looking into events in the Brovary district, which lies to the northeast. The prosecutor's office said the bodies of six civilians had been found with gunshot wounds in a basement in the village of Shevchenkove and that Russian forces were believed to be responsible. Prosecutors are also investigating allegations that Russian forces fired on a convoy of civilians trying to leave by car from the village of Peremoha in the Brovary district, killing four people, including a 13-year-old boy. In another attack near Bucha, five people were killed, including two children, when a car was fired upon, prosecutors said. Putin falsely claimed Tuesday that Ukraine's accusation that hundreds of civilians were killed by Russian troops in the town of Bucha were “fake.” Associated Press reporters saw dozens of bodies in and around the town, some with hands bound who appeared to have been shot at close range. The Russian leader spoke at the Vostochny space launch facility in the country's Far East, during his first known foray outside Moscow since the war began. He also said that foreign powers wouldn’t succeed in isolating Russia. He said that Russia’s economy and financial system withstood the blow from what he called the Western sanctions “blitz” and claimed they would backfire by driving up prices for essentials such as fertilizer, leading to food shortages and increase migration flows to the West. Addressing the pace of the campaign, Putin said Russia was proceeding “calmly and rhythmically” because it wanted to “achieve the planned goals while minimizing the losses.” While building up forces in the east, Russia continued to strike targets across Ukraine in a bid to wear down the country’s defenses. Russia’s defense ministry said Tuesday that it used used air- and sea-launched missiles to destroy an ammunition depot and airplane hangar at Starokostiantyniv in the western Khmelnytskyi region and an ammunition depot near Kyiv. ——— Karmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

"The routes are a ""desperate measure in dire times,"" a Red Cross official said. Ukraine refugees: Families torn apart as women, children flee alone For tens of thousands of civilians trapped in active combat zones in Ukraine, the establishment of humanitarian corridors could mean the difference between living and dying, experts said. At least nine humanitarian corridors are expected to open in war-torn areas of eastern Ukraine this week to allow civilians to escape heavy fighting, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. More than 4,354 people used the opened humanitarian corridors on Monday to evacuate via buses and private cars, according to Vereshchuk. She said the same safe passages will be open on Tuesday. But the designated routes out of besieged towns such as Mariupol in southeast Ukraine and areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine can be dangerous if not done with precision and complete transparency, Crystal Wells, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told ABC News. “We see humanitarian corridors, that we refer to as safe passages, as really a desperate measure in dire times,"" Wells said. Humanitarian corridors are routes for civilians to escape from the most dangerous war zones. The safe passages require Russian and Ukrainian leaders to agree on specific routes and a ceasefire span of time along those thoroughfares to allow civilians a window of opportunity to get out of the crossfire. Safe passageways during wars date back to World War II, when routes were established to transport 10,000 children from Nazi-controlled countries in humanitarian rescues dubbed ""kindertransports."" The Geneva Conventions in 1949 also established rules to ensure civilians had access to humanitarian supplies, including food and medicine, during war. ""It’s important, first of all, to remember that civilians are actually protected under international humanitarian law. Those are the laws that govern armed conflict,"" Wells said. ""And civilians should be protected from hostilities whether they’re in their homes, in a hospital, in a school or in a so-called humanitarian corridor."" But Wells said that some humanitarian routes opened in Ukraine had to quickly be closed or not used at all because hostilities resumed. ""It’s not like all of a sudden a humanitarian corridors comes in and it's a magic wand to ending civilian suffering,"" Wells said. “It's so important that these are agreed on not just in principle but in concrete terms so that it’s not only the people sitting in capital cities who agree. It needs to come down to actionable, concrete, logistical details, and it has to be communicated down the chain of command to the militaries on the ground for these to work safely."" She said if details of a humanitarian corridor, including the precise routes and ceasefire times, are not conveyed to frontline troops, it could create a dangerous -- and deadly -- situation. “It's not just about the safety of our teams, but it's to not also lead people or accompany people into something where they could be in harm's way,"" Wells said. In the absence of humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian civilians have risked their lives trying to flee battle zones on their own. Many have been killed. “What's been happening in cities like Mariupol is that in the absence of these concrete agreements, you have civilians leaving, but they’re doing so in a very ad hoc way. They’re making a life-and-death decision to go, and there’s not a ceasefire agreement in place and there’s not specifics about routes and the times and all of that. So, it’s very risky for people."" Much of the focus for humanitarian agencies in recent days has been on Mariupol, a port city of nearly 400,000 people that has been under siege since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told the Associated Press by telephone Monday that the death toll in his city has surpassed 10,000 and could reach double that as attacks continue. Boychenko also alleged Russian forces have brought mobile crematoriums to Mariupol to collect and incinerate civilian bodies in an attempt to cover up evidence of war crimes. Russia has denied committing atrocities in Ukraine and claims it is not targeting civilians. Vereshchuk said in a statement posted on social media Monday that humanitarian evacuation routes were agreed upon for those traveling by private cars from Mariupol. Wells estimated that more than 100,000 civilians remain in Mariupol. ""For us, Mariupol really remains very much a focus and a priority,"" Wells said. ""That’s a city that’s been for weeks now without any humanitarian aid. They’ve been for weeks now without really any proper safe passage for civilians out of the city."" She said ICRC teams have been trying for weeks to deliver humanitarian aid to Mariupol without success. ""We tried again a couple of Fridays ago to access Mariupol, and our teams spent five days and five nights on the road trying to get into the city, and security conditions didn’t allow it,"" Wells said. Wells said the ICRC has successfully used designated safe passages to get civilians out of the hard-hit town of Sumy in northeast Ukraine and between the Russian-controlled city Berdyansk to safety in Zaporizhzhia, a roughly 120-mile journey. She said an unarmed ICRC convoy from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia last week included buses and Red Cross land cruisers clearly marked with the agency's emblem at the front and rear of the caravan. Wells said many of the civilians who joined the convoy were fleeing Mariupol. ""We had seven buses with seven volunteer bus drivers, and that would allow about 350 people to board,"" Wells said. ""But then we had private cars starting to join the convoy from Berdyansk all the way to Zaporizhzhia. By the end of that convoy to Zaporizhzhia, they estimated there were about 100 civilian cars, which got us up to about 1,000 people."" Wells said the evacuation from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia took two days. She said a similar mission in Mariupol would likely take longer. ""To think of doing it for 100,000 people, we would really need agreements to hold for not just hours, but days,"" Wells said. No matter how much time is granted to the humanitarian corridors, Wells said some civilians are bound to get left behind. ""What about the elderly? What about people with disabilities? Not everyone is able-bodied to get into their own car or board a bus and leave,"" Wells said. ""So, that’s where it’s also important that aid needs to be brought into these places as well and that civilians still have to be protected and respected from hostilities.""",4
"Ukrainian officials are investigating claims Russia used chemical weapons. Are war crimes happening in Ukraine? LONDON -- Tens of thousands of civilians could be dead in Mariupol, the city's mayor said, as analysts warn that Russia is regrouping for a renewed assault on eastern Ukraine. The streets in Mariupol are “carpeted” with bodies, Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said Monday. While there is no confirmed number of casualties, the mayor suggested the number of dead could be well over 10,000 in the coastal town, the site of some of the worst bombardment since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. ""If it is possible to mention such a terrifying number, then it is above 10,000. According to our estimates, it is 20,000 plus, unfortunately,” Boychenko said in an interview with the Associated Press. Russian airstrikes have battered the southeastern city over the past few weeks targeting all kinds of buildings, including a theatre housing those seeking refuge, a maternity hospital and an art school. Officials say that over 80 percent of the city is destroyed. With the city almost completely cut off from the outside world, it has been difficult for the authorities to verify atrocities alleged to have been committed on the ground, including claims made Monday by the Azov battalion, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian National Guard, that Russia may have used chemical weapons against the Ukrainian forces in the city. The claims could not be independently verified by ABC News. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office and the country's ministry of defense said they are investigating the claims. “We are currently confirming this information, trying to understand what it was. According to preliminary information, we can say that it is possible– that it was, rather, a phosphorous munition. Official information will be finalized later,"" Hanna Maliar, Deputy Minister of Defence, said during a national news broadcast. A spokesman for Russian-backed separatists, Eduard Basurin, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Tuesday that they ""haven't used any chemical weapons in Mariupol."" But on the eve of the alleged attack, Basurin made the case on Russian TV that his forces should use chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops to ""smoke them out."" Late on Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby issued a statement saying that the use of a substance cannot be confirmed, but expressed concerns about Russia’s potential use of “riot control agents including tear gas mixed with chemical agents.” “We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol, Ukraine. We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” the statement reads. Britain's armed forces minister said on Tuesday that should Russia resort to the use of chemical weapons in the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, ""all possible options are on the table in terms of how the West might respond” in response to the speculation, saying the reports had not been verified. Whether or not phosphorous is considered a chemical weapon is a topic of debate among militaries and governments. Although phosphorus is not classified as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Geneva Convention forbids its use as an incendiary weapon in civilian areas. Amidst the reports of Russia regrouping behind its own borders, the British Ministry of Defense warned today that the fighting is set to intensify over the next two-three weeks with a renewed assault. “Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there,” the U.K.'s ministry of defense stated in a tweet. “Russian attacks remain focused on Ukrainian positions near Donetsk and Luhansk with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push towards Kramatorsk. Russian forces continue to withdraw from Belarus in order to redeploy in support of operations in eastern Ukraine,"" the post added.",6
"French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has warned against sending any more weapons to Ukraine PARIS -- French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen warned Wednesday against sending any more weapons to Ukraine, and called for a rapprochement between NATO and Russia once Moscow’s war in Ukraine winds down. Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist who has long ties to Russia, also confirmed that if she unseats President Emmanuel Macron in France’s April 24 presidential runoff, she will pull France out of NATO’s military command and dial back French support for the whole European Union. Macron, a pro-EU centrist, is facing a harder-than-expected fight to stay in power, in part because the economic impact of the war is hitting poor households the hardest. France’s European partners are worried that a possible Le Pen presidency could undermine Western unity as the U.S. and Europe seek to support Ukraine and end Russia’s ruinous war on its neighbor. Asked about military aid to Ukraine, Le Pen said she would continue defense and intelligence support. “(But) I’m more reserved about direct arms deliveries. Why? Because ... the line is thin between aid and becoming a co-belligerent,” the far-right leader said, citing concerns about an “escalation of this conflict that could bring a whole number of countries into a military commitment.” Earlier Wednesday, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said France had sent 100 million euros ($109 million) worth of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks as part of a flow of Western arms. Earlier in his term, Macron had tried to reach out to Russian President Vladimir Putin to improve Russia’s relations with the West, and Macron met with Putin weeks before the Russian invasion in an unsuccessful effort to prevent it. Since then, however, France has supported EU sanctions against Moscow and has offered sustained support to Ukraine. Le Pen also said France should strike a more independent path from the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. And despite the atrocities that Russian troops have committed in Ukraine, Le Pen said that NATO should seek a “strategic rapprochement” with Russia once the war is over. Such a relationship would be “in the interest of France and Europe and I think even of the United States,” she said, to stop Russia from forging a stronger alliance with world power China. She did not directly address the horrors unfolding in Ukraine. Le Pen was speaking at a press conference Wednesday to lay out her foreign policy plans, which include halting aid to African countries unless they take back “undesirable” migrants seeking entry to France. She also wants to slash support for international efforts to improve women’s reproductive health in poor countries, increase minority rights or solve environmental problems. At the end of the event, protesters held up a poster showing a 2017 meeting between Le Pen and Putin. One activist was pulled out of the room. Anti-racism protesters also held a small demonstration outside. “The election of Madame Le Pen would mean electing an admirer of Putin’s regime, an autocratic regime and an admirer of Putin’s imperialistic logic,” said Dominique Sopo, head of the group SOS Racism. “It would mean that France would become a vassal to Putin’s Russia.” ——— Follow all AP stories related to France's 2022 presidential election at https://apnews.com/hub/ french-election-2022. ——— Follow all AP stories on Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",3
"European Union nations Finland and Sweden have reached important stages on their way to possible NATO membership HELSINKI -- European Union nations Finland and Sweden reached important stages Wednesday on their way to possible NATO membership as the Finnish government issued a security report to lawmakers and Sweden’s ruling party initiated a review of security policy options. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 triggered a surge in support for joining NATO in the two traditionally militarily non-aligned Nordic countries, with polls showing a majority of respondents willing to join the alliance in Finland and supporters of NATO in Sweden clearly outnumbering those against the idea. Finland, a country of 5.5 million, shares the EU's longest border with Russia, a 1,340-kilometer (833-mile) frontier. Sweden has no border with Russia. Russia, for its part, has warned Sweden and Finland against joining NATO, with officials saying it would not contribute to stability in Europe. Officials said Russia would respond to such a move with retaliatory measures that would cause “military and political consequences” for Helsinki and Stockholm. One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's reasons for invading Ukraine was that the country refused to promise that it would not join NATO. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, speaking Wednesday in Stockholm in a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart Magdalena Andersson, said Finland is ready to make a decision on NATO “within weeks” rather than months following an extensive debate in the 200-seat Eduskunta legislature. Marin stressed that Finland and Sweden, two neighboring Nordic countries which have close economic, political and military ties, will make independent decisions regarding their security policy arrangements, including whether to join NATO. “But we do that with a clear understanding that our choices will affect not only ourselves but our neighbors as well,” Marin said, adding that she would prefer seeing both Finland and Sweden becoming NATO members. Andersson said Sweden and Finland would maintain “a very close dialogue and have a very straightforward and honest discussions” in the coming weeks over their countries respective choices on NATO. The only real option to NATO membership could be an enhanced bilateral military cooperation added with the United States and Nordic NATO member Norway, Finnish experts have said. Marin and Andersson lead the ruling Social Democratic Parties in their respective countries. The parties are expected to announce their NATO views in early and late May, respectively. Parliaments in both countries are ready to finally decide the matter — something that could happen in Finland in late May and a bit later in Sweden. Complicating things in Sweden is the general election in September, which is likely to be dominated by the NATO issue. In Finland, President Sauli Niinisto said he was convinced that his country’s decision on NATO will be ready well ahead of NATO’s June 29-30 summit in Madrid, Spain. On Wednesday, the Finnish government issued a much-awaited report on changes in Finland’s security environment that lawmakers will start debating after the Easter break. The report addresses the pros and cons of Finland’s possible membership in NATO, focusing on supply threats, economic effects, cybersecurity and hydrid threats. “The war started by Russia endangers security and stability in entire Europe,” Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said as he presented the report. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine will have a long-lasting impact on our own security environment. Trust in Russia has plummeted.” Andersson said Wednesday that the Swedish government is working on a security environment analysis together with all parties in the 349-seat Riksdag legislature. She said the report is due May 31 but could be finished earlier. In addition, Andersson's Social Democratic Party has initiated its own separate review of Sweden's security environment. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"The detention of fugitive Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, the former leader of a pro-Russian opposition party and a close associate of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, has been met with enthusiasm in Kyiv and irritation in Moscow LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's detention of fugitive Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, the former leader of a pro-Russian opposition party and a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been met with enthusiasm in Kyiv and irritation in Moscow. Analysts saying Medvedchuk will become a valuable pawn in the Russia-Ukraine talks to end the devastating war that the Kremlin has unleashed on its ex-Soviet neighbor. Medvedchuk was detained on Tuesday in a special operation carried out by Ukraine's state security service, or the SBU. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed that Russia could win Medvedchuk’s freedom by trading Ukrainians now held captive by the Russians. The 67-year-old oligarch escaped from house arrest several days before the hostilities broke out Feb. 24 in Ukraine. He is facing between 15 years and a life in prison on charges of treason and aiding and abetting a terrorist organization for mediating coal purchases for the separatist, Russia-backed Donetsk republic in eastern Ukraine. Medvedchuk has close ties with Putin, who is believed to be the godfather of his youngest daughter. His detention has sparked a heated exchange between officials in Moscow and Kyiv. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's Security Council and the country's former president, posted threats to Ukrainian authorities on the messaging app Telegram, referring to them as “freaks” and warning them to “carefully look around and firmly lock the doors at night.” Zelenskyy's advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, in response, called Medvedev a “nobody,” and said his words were “nasty and, as usual, stupid.” “The friendly relations between Putin and Medvedchuk turn him into a valuable trophy for Kyiv, and in the Kremlin they spark fury and a dangerous desire for revenge,” Volodymyr Fesenko, an analyst at the Penta Center, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “The fate of Medvedchuk will undoubtedly become a subject of bargaining and one of the points of undercover agreements between Kyiv and Moscow.” Zelenskyy has released a photo of Medvedchuk sitting in handcuffs and wearing a camouflage uniform with a Ukrainian flag patch, in which he looks tired but visibly unharmed. Medvedchuk’s wife Oksana Marchenko has appealed to Zelenskyy, calling for her husband to be released and given guarantees that “his life would not be in danger.” “My husband is being persecuted for political reasons against the laws of Ukraine,” Marchenko said. Medvedchuk is the head of the political council of Ukraine's pro-Russian Opposition Platform — For Life party, the largest opposition group in the Ukrainian parliament. He is one of its 44 lawmakers in the 450-seat Rada. The activity of his party has been was suspended for the duration of the war at Zelenskyy's initiative. “The war automatically turned Medvedchuk into (Russia's) accomplice, since he personally advised Putin on Ukrainian affairs and directly or indirectly influenced many of the Kremlin’s decisions,” Fesenko said. “Zelenskyy no longer needs to be careful, and by arresting Medvedchuk, he wants to show that he is not afraid of the Kremlin and is ready to bargain, having different cards on the negotiating table.” Ivan Bakanov, the head of Ukraine’s national security agency, said Wednesday that the Russian security service, the FSB, had planned to evacuate Medvedchuk, disguised as a Ukrainian serviceman, to Moscow through the disputed territory of Transnistria in Moldova, where Russia has troops stationed. ——— Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",2
"Legal and moral taboos were shattered with the use of chemical weapons during Syria's civil war On Location: April 15, 2022 BEIRUT -- The chilling scenes from Syria of victims twitching and gasping for air after chlorine cylinders were dropped from helicopters in towns and villages were broadcast over and over in the course of country's civil war. Legal and moral taboos were shattered. Hundreds were killed, including many children, in dozens of poison gas attacks widely blamed on President Bashar Assad’s forces under the protection of his chief ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several years later, concerns are growing that such weapons could be used in Ukraine, where Russian forces have been waging a devastating war for weeks. As the conflict drags on, Western officials and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have warned that Putin could deploy chemical agents. “The world must react now,” Zelenskyy said. Officials say they are investigating an unconfirmed claim by a far-right Ukrainian regiment that a poisonous substance was dropped in the besieged city of Mariupol this week. The claim could not be confirmed by independent sources, and Ukrainian officials say it could have been phosphorus munitions - which cause horrendous burns but are not classed as chemical weapons. LOWERING THE THRESHOLD Putin has threatened to broaden the Ukraine war into a nuclear conflict, but it is unclear if chemical agents will be used to support his military operations. Analysts say the Syria war set a horrific precedent in terms of deploying chlorine, sulfur and the nerve agent sarin, completely disregarding international norms and with no accountability. “From what we’re seeing now, it seems that Russia has drawn the conclusion that it’s safe to continue this modus operandi from Syria in the Ukrainian context as well,” said Aida Samani, legal adviser with Civil Rights Defenders, a Sweden-based group. “Of course, that undermines the international regulations that we have in place and lowers the threshold for the use of such weapons,” Samani added. She has joined with other nongovernmental organizations to file a criminal complaint on behalf of a group of Syrians living in Sweden against the Syrian government for war crimes and crimes against humanity related to its use of chemical weapons. Western officials say Russia may be looking to borrow from the Syria playbook, where Assad’s forces tested the international community’s resolve by gradually ramping up the brutality of attacks and methods. Part of the equation in Syria was the difficulty of proving anything in the aftermath of such attacks, largely due to the lack of immediate access. Assad, with Russia’s backing, consistently cast a cloud of confusion, accusing the opposition of fabricating evidence or deploying poison gas themselves to try to frame him. An investigative mechanism set up by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons blamed Syrian government forces for multiple chemical attacks in Syria, including the use of chlorine and sarin in an attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that killed about 100 people. At least one mustard gas attack was blamed on the Islamic State group, which held territory in Syria and Iraq for several years during the war that killed half a million people. In comments reminiscent of Syria, Russia accused Ukraine of running chemical and biological labs with U.S. support, leading to accusations Moscow was seeking to stage a false-flag incident. Ukraine does have a network of biological labs that have gotten funding and research support from the U.S. — but they are part of a program seeking to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks by pathogens, whether natural or manmade. The U.S. efforts date to the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s program for weapons of mass destruction. RED LINES The assault early on the morning of Aug. 21, 2013, on the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus known as Ghouta shocked a world that had grown largely numb to the carnage of Syria’s civil war. Fueling the international outrage were dozens of online videos showing victims in spasms, gasping for breath and foaming at the mouth. The attack crossed what then-U.S. President Barack Obama had called a “red line” for possible military intervention in the Arab country. Obama came close to ordering U.S.-led military strikes but abruptly backed down after failing to secure the necessary support from the U.S. Congress and instead struck a deal with Moscow to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal. By August 2014, Assad’s government declared that the destruction of its chemical weapons was completed. But Syria’s initial declaration to the OPCW has remained in dispute, and the attacks continued. In 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump launched several dozen cruise missiles at a Syrian air base in retaliation for a suspected nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib province that killed about 100 people. Experts from the U.N. and the chemical weapons watchdog blamed the Syrian government for the attack. As Moscow pushes its offensive in Ukraine, world leaders and policymakers are grappling with how the West should respond to a Russian battlefield use of chemical or biological weapons. Members of Congress said the Biden administration and its allies will not stand by if that happens. Unlike Syria, however, Russia is a nuclear power. Any reaction risks triggering a nuclear confrontation, which Putin has already alluded to. ACHIEVING JUSTICE Samani, of Civil Rights Defenders, faults the international community for not making a real effort to seek accountability for the chemical weapons attacks in Syria. “There hasn’t really been any political appetite to explore how, for example, a special tribunal could be set up for Syria,” she said. Last week, she and a group of NGOs presented new information relevant to the sarin gas attacks on Khan Sheikhun in 2017 and Ghouta in 2013 to investigative authorities in Germany, France and Sweden. But justice appears to be a long way off. “Holding the perpetrators of these crimes accountable for the use of illegal weapons is the first deterrent to ensure that they do not recur,” said Haneen Haddad, project leader for the Syrian Archive, a Syrian-led project that documents human rights violations and other crimes committed in Syria. “Without meaningful accountability, cruel actors and their enablers think that they can do terrible things without real consequence from the international community.” —- Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"Ukraine's President Zelenskyy called his comments ""true words of a true leader."" Biden doubles down on 'genocide' claim in Ukraine President Joe Biden is getting both praise and criticism after doubling down on describing Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"" -- the first time he's used the term since the invasion began nearly 50 days ago -- even as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for weeks has claimed that is what's happening on the ground. White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended his use of the term, as she did when Biden called Putin a ""war criminal"" and when he said ""cannot remain in power,"" saying Wednesday the president was simply expressing ""what he feels."" ""The president was speaking to what we all see, and what he feels as clear as day in terms of the atrocities happening on the ground, as he also noted yesterday,"" Psaki said, before tempering his use of the term. ""Of course, there will be a legal process that plays out in the courtroom but he was speaking to what he has seen on the ground, what we have all seen in terms of the atrocities on the ground."" Pressed directly on whether Biden's comments might conflict with the U.S. policy, Psaki dismissed concerns and repeated the requirement of a ""legal process"" which can sometimes take years. ""He was not getting ahead of that. He was speaking on what he feels he sees on the ground,"" she said. ""I do not think anybody is confused about the atrocities we are seeing on the ground -- and different leaders around the world describe it in different ways,"" Psaki added later on. ""It is unquestionable that what we are seeing is horrific, the targeting of civilians, hospitals, children. The president was calling it like he sees it, and that is what he does."" State Department spokesperson Ned Price gave a similar line at his briefing Wednesday, saying Biden used the term based on ""impressions that he has seen and that we all have seen,"" but noted the U.S. is working with international lawyers to determine if Russia's crimes meet the legal threshold. During prepared remarks in Iowa Tuesday blaming inflation and gas prices on ""Putin's price hike,"" Biden said, for the first time, ""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should on hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away."" His use of the word raised questions among Washington reporters about whether it was an ad-libbed moment or a policy shift from the White House -- until Biden later insisted he meant exactly what said. ""Yes, I called it genocide,"" Biden told reporters after his remarks. ""Because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian. And the evidence is mounting. It's different than it was last week, the more evidence is coming out of the -- literally, the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine and we're going to only learn more and more about the devastation."" Genocide is defined as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" according to the United Nations' Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Biden went on to acknowledge the U.S. government has an internal, legal process for designating whether genocide has occurred but still stood by what he indicated was his opinion. ""We'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me,"" Biden added. Zelenskyy has argued -- and pleaded -- for weeks that Russia has met this definition and called on Western leaders to use the same term, so was quick to applaud Biden's comments as ""true words of a true leader."" The Kremlin, meanwhile, blasted the comment as Putin indicated this week indicated his invasion won't stop until his goals are met and said peace talks with Kyiv had reached a ""dead end."" ""We consider this kind of effort to distort the situation unacceptable,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. ""This is hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times."" It's not clear how many Western leaders will go as far as Biden and Zelenskyy -- or what will take for them to reach the same conclusion. No other Western nations have made the determination, aside from Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tying Russia's crimes to the term in a tweet. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Wednesday he's more ""careful"" with his words than the American president, saying only that ""war crimes"" have been confirmed. ""So far, it has been established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and bring them to justice,"" Macron told France 2 in an interview. ""I am very careful with some terms [genocide] these days,"" he added. ""I'm not sure the escalation of words is helping the cause right now."" Asked directly by ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce about Macron's criticism Wednesday, Psaki declined to comment. Macron also rebuked Biden's language last month, when asked about Biden calling Putin a ""butcher"" and saying he ""cannot remain in power"" during remarks in Warsaw. ""I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin,"" Macron said in another interview with France 3. ""Because what do we want to do collectively? We want to stop the war that Russia launched in Ukraine, without waging war and without escalation."" Biden stood by his words then, saying he was ""expressing moral outrage"" but also clarified that he wasn't ""articulating a policy change"" amid some fallout. It's unclear now what pushed Biden to change his stance on using the term ""genocide"" -- because asked directly last week if he thought the atrocities documented in Bucha were genocide, he said no. ""I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden said on April 4. ""He is a war criminal -- but we have to gather the information, we have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this could be an actual -- have a war crime trial. This guy is brutal. What's happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone sees it."" Asked directly, ""You agree this is genocide?"" “No, it is a war crime,"" Biden replied. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan followed Biden's comment the same day by saying the administration had not yet seen the ""systematic deprivation of life"" necessary to meet the definition of genocide. ""This is something we, of course, continue to monitor every day. Based on what we have seen so far, we have seen atrocities, we have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide,"" Sullivan said.

"The capital of France may be thousands of miles away from the battlefields of eastern Ukraine, but what happens in French voting stations this month could have repercussions there On Location: April 13, 2022 PARIS -- The capital of France may be thousands of miles away from the battlefields of eastern Ukraine, but what happens in French voting stations this month could have repercussions there. Far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has close ties to Russia and wants to weaken the European Union and NATO, which could undercut Western efforts to stop Russia's war on Ukraine. Le Pen is trying to unseat centrist President Emmanuel Macron, who has a slim lead in polls ahead of France's April 24 presidential runoff election. Here are some of the ways the French election could impact the war in Ukraine: ARMING UKRAINE Macron’s government has sent 100 million euros worth of weaponry to Ukraine in recent weeks and said Wednesday it will send more as part of a Western military aid effort. France has been a major source of military support for Ukraine since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 from Ukraine and supported separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine. Le Pen expressed reservations Wednesday about supplying Ukraine with additional arms. She said, if she were elected president, she would continue defense and intelligence aid but would be “prudent” about sending weapons because she thinks the shipments could suck other countries into the war with Russia. SOFTENING SANCTIONS Le Pen’s campaign has successfully tapped into French voter frustration over rising inflation, which has worsened as a consequence of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine and the ensuing Western sanctions against Russia, a major gas supplier and trade partner for France and Europe. The European Union has been unusually unified in agreeing on five rounds of ever-tougher sanctions against Russia. If she became France's president, Le Pen could try to thwart or limit additional EU sanctions since further action requires unananimous backing from the bloc’s 27 member nations. France is the EU’s No. 2 economy after Germany and key to EU decision-making. France also now holds the rotating EU presidency, giving France’s next leader significant influence. Le Pen is notably opposed to sanctions on Russian gas and oil. She also said in the past that she would work to lift sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea, and even recognize Crimea as part of Russia. COURTING PUTIN Earlier in his first term, Macron tried reaching out to Putin, inviting him to Versailles and a presidential resort on the Mediterranean, in hopes of bringing Russia's policies back into greater alignment with the West. The French president also sought to revive peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv over the long-running conflict in eastern Ukraine between the government and Russia-backed separatists. Macron visited Putin at the Kremlin weeks before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and has continued talking to the Russian leader during the war. At the same time, Macron has supported multiple rounds of EU sanctions. Le Pen’s party has deep ties to Russia. She met with Putin as a French presidential candidate in 2017 and has praised him in the past. She is warmly welcomed at Russian Embassy events in Paris, and her far-right party also got a 9 million-euro ($9.8 million) loan from a Russian-Czech bank because she said French banks refused to lend the party money. Le Pen says the war in Ukraine has partly changed her mind about Putin, but she said Wednesday that the West should try to restore relations with Russia once the conflict ends. She suggested a “strategic rapprochement” between NATO and Russia to keep Moscow from allying too closely with China. WEAKENING NATO AND THE EU While Macron is a staunch defender of the EU and recently reinforced France's participation in NATO operations in Eastern Europe, Le Pen says France should keep its distance from international alliances and strike its own path. She favors pulling France out of NATO’s military command, which would take French military staff out of the body that plans operations and lead to the country losing influence within the Western military alliance. France withdrew from NATO's command structure in 1966, when French President Charles de Gaulle wanted to distance his country from the U.S.-dominated organization, and reintegrated under conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009. If it were up to her, Le Pen would reduce French spending on the EU and try to diminish the EU’s influence by chipping away at the bloc from within while no longer recognizing that European law has primacy over national law. ———— Follow AP's coverage of France's presidential election at https://apnews.com/hub/french-election-2022 ——— Follow all AP stories on Russia’s war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",3
"China says it will reject “any pressure or coercion"" over its relationship with Russia On Location: April 14, 2022 BEIJING -- China on Thursday said it would reject “any pressure or coercion” over its relationship with Russia, in response to a call from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for Beijing to use its “special relationship with Russia” to persuade Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian defended China’s position on the war, saying it had “made considerable efforts to de-escalate the situation, defuse the crisis and rebuild peace."" “China is playing a constructive role in the Ukraine issue,"" Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing. China has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by strategic partner Russia, or even refer to the conflict as a war in deference to Moscow, which uses the term “special military operation."" “We oppose unfounded accusations and suspicions against China, nor will we accept any pressure or coercion,"" Zhao said. “Time will tell that China’s claims are on the right side of history."" China has also amplified Russian propaganda about the war, including unsupported claims that the U.S. and Ukraine have been developing biological weapons. It has staunchly opposed economic sanctions against Russia and has abstained or sided with Moscow in U.N. votes following the beginning of the war on Feb. 24, just weeks after Russian leader Vladimir Putin met with China's Xi Jinping in Beijing. In a speech Wednesday, Yellen said Beijing “cannot expect the global community to respect its appeals to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity in the future if it does not respect these principles now.” “The world’s attitude towards China and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by China’s reaction to our call for resolute action on Russia,” she said. Yellen’s speech at the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank, came a week before the world’s finance ministers and central bank governors convene in Washington for the International Monetary Fund-World Bank Group Spring Meetings. Her direct appeal to China underscores an increasing frustration that the United States and its allies have with a country that has only deepened its ties with Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. Making no mention of Russia's aggression, Zhao reiterated China's stance that it “maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and safeguarded,"" and that “Ukraine’s sovereignty and security should be preserved, and Russia’s legitimate security concerns should also be respected.""",6
"The COVID test positivity rate currently sits at 6.2%, above the 5% threshold. Boston COVID test positivity rate passes ‘threshold of concern'  Boston public health officials are urging residents to take extra precautions as COVID-19 cases tick up ahead of the upcoming holiday weekend. In a blog post Wednesday, the Boston Public Health Commission said the city's test positivity rate currently sits at 6.2%, which is above the agency's ""threshold of concern"" of 5%. It's also nearly three times higher than the 2.2% test positivity rate recorded one month ago. Additionally, data shows young adults between ages 20 and 30 are driving the increase and have the highest case rate in Boston. Ahead of several holidays -- including Passover, Easter and Ramadan -- and the 126th running of the Boston Marathon Monday, the BPHC recommended wearing a well-fitting mask, getting tested before attending indoors gatherings, and getting vaccinated or boosted. ""Celebrating with family and friends is an important and treasured time and, as cases increase, we must remain vigilant so we can be together safely,"" Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Commissioner of Public Health and Executive Director of the BPHC, said in a statement. ""We have the tools … to stay safe and lower the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness."" Experts said the increase in Boston is mostly due to the spread of BA.2, a highly infectious subvariant of the original BA.1 omicron variant. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, BA.2 makes up more than 90% of cases that have undergone genome sequencing in New England. ""It's nothing compared to what we saw in terms of the huge and dramatic spike when BA.1 was in the process of replacing the delta variant,"" Dr. Shira Doron, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, told ABC News. ""It's an uptick, it's not what we want, but it's much less significant than BA.1."" Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said health officials had been preparing for an increase in the city after seeing cases rise in Western Europe due to BA.2 a few weeks ago. ""Whatever happens in Western Europe [with COVID-19] has been a harbinger of what's going to come in the United States,"" he told ABC News. ""You can almost set your calendar by it."" However, there may be some positive signs that this increase in cases will not lead to another wave. At Tufts Medical Center, Doron said there are more people seeking COVID-19 treatment at outpatient facilities compared to a few weeks ago, but there has not been an increase in hospitalizations. She added that there has also been a small increase of employees testing positive every day, but it's not causing staffing shortages. ""It's not straining our ability to properly staff, it's not straining our ability to get people in for monoclonal antibodies if they need it,"" Doron said. Experts suggested one reason why COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations may not be surging as they did during the winter is because so many people were infected during the omicron wave that they may have boosted their immunity. ""So many people came down with COVID during the last wave ... that they either knew someone who had it, or they had it themselves"" Sax said. Both doctors recommended similar precautions to the BPHC over the holiday weekend including getting tested before gathering with family and friends and taking measures, such as masking indoors, especially if someone is immunocompromised. Sax also recommended anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and is experiencing symptoms contact their doctor to see if they're eligible for Paxlovid, Pfizer's antiviral pill. ""Unlike our previous waves, we are lucky enough to have an antiviral treatment,"" Sax said. ""The key is to take it quickly so, as soon as they get diagnosed, they should see if they are eligible because it could really help prevent the most dreaded complications of COVID-19.""",6
"The Moskva is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.  Ukrainian forces claim to have crippled Russian war ship, Moskva The Russian Defense Ministry announced on Thursday that its Black Sea Fleet flagship vessel, Moskva, sunk after losing its stability when it was towed to a port. Russia said the ship sustained damages during a fire started by the detonation of ammunition. Ukrainian government officials, on Wednesday, claimed its armed forces fired missiles that struck the vessel, causing damage. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych and Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, said there was an explosion and that the cruiser is on fire. The governor of Odessa Maksym Marchenko claimed on Telegram that two anti-ship cruise missiles struck the cruiser in the Black Sea, causing ""very serious damage."" Russia earlier said the ship was seriously damaged, but did not confirm that was due to Ukrainian strikes. Russia claimed a fire abroad the ship forced all 510 members of the crew to evacuate. ""As a result of a fire, ammunition has detonated on the Moskva missile cruiser. The ship was seriously damaged. The crew was completely evacuated,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""The cause of the fire is under investigation,"" the statement said. Russia later said the fire aboard the ship was contained and that the Moskva will be towed to a port. Russia's Defense Ministry said the main missile weapons on board were not damaged, but made no mention of missile strikes in its statement. A senior U.S. defense official told reporters the U.S. assesses that the crew of the Moskva is still battling a fire aboard the ship. About a half-dozen other ships that had been close to the Moskva have now moved further away from the coast into the Black Sea, the official also said. The Pentagon said it can not confirm or deny whether the ship was hit by a missile. ""We cannot confirm the Ukrainian reports that it was hit by a missile but we are also not in a position to refute that it could have been a Ukrainian missile which struck the ship,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters at a briefing on Thursday. Noting that the U.S. does not have perfect visibility into the situation, Kirby said, ""we do believe that there was a significant explosion on this cruiser the Moskva of a Slava class of cruisers in the Russian Navy. We do believe that that that explosion caused a significant fire, which as of this morning was still raging aboard the ship."" Kirby said ""at least some"" of the Moskva's crew had evacuated to other Russian Navy ships but he couldn't say it was the entire crew. He added that the U.S. doesn't have ""a better, clearer sense of the damage done"" and whether the ship could be repaired. In an interview on MSNBC Thursday, Kirby said there wasn't enough information to determine if the explosion was in fact caused by a Ukrainian missile strike, though it can't be ruled out. Despite the Russian Defense Ministry claiming the ship was being towed, Kirby said it was under its own power and looked to be headed east toward Sevastopol in Crimea. ""She was operating about 60 miles or so south of Odessa and we know she suffered an explosion,"" Kirby said on MSNBC.  ""It looks like from the images that we've been able to look at it looks like there's a pretty sizable explosion too."" Kirby later told reporters the U.S.'s assessment is now more uncertain that was now the case. “While we had assessed that the ship was underway under its own power, we are no longer able to make that certainty today, this afternoon,” he said. “We're not exactly sure that the ship is actually still able to make its own way. Kirby told reporters that so far Russia’s Navy has been limited to launching cruise missile strikes inside Ukraine and resupply efforts. “It remains to be seen exactly what the major impact is going to be,” said Kirby. On CNN, Kirby said the U.S. is unaware what caused at least one explosion abroad the ship, describing the explosion as ""a fairly major one at that, that has caused extensive damage to the ship."" -ABC News' Fidel Pavlenko, Luis Martinez, Oleksiy Pshemyskyi and Yulia Drozd contributed to this report",6
"The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet sank after it was heavily damaged in the latest setback for Moscow’s invasion KYIV, Ukraine -- The flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, a guided-missile cruiser that became a potent target of Ukrainian defiance in the opening days of the war, sank Thursday after it was heavily damaged in the latest setback for Moscow's invasion. Ukrainian officials said their forces hit the vessel with missiles, while Russia acknowledged a fire aboard the Moskva but no attack. U.S. and other Western officials could not confirm what caused the blaze. The loss of the warship named for the Russian capital is a devastating symbolic defeat for Moscow as its troops regroup for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine after retreating from much of the north, including the capital, Kyiv. In his nightly video address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to the sinking as he told Ukrainians they should be proud of having survived 50 days under attack when the Russians “gave us a maximum of five.” Listing the many ways Ukraine has defended against the invasion, he noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea. It was his only reference to the missile cruiser. The Russian Defense Ministry said the ship sank in a storm while being towed to a port. Russia earlier said the flames on the ship, which would typically have 500 sailors aboard, forced the entire crew to evacuate. Later it said the blaze had been contained. The Moskva had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, and its removal reduces Russia’s firepower in the Black Sea. It's also a blow to Moscow's prestige in a war already widely seen as a historic blunder. Now entering its eighth week, the invasion has stalled amid resistance from Ukrainian fighters bolstered by weapons and other aid sent by Western nations. During the first days of the war, the Moskva was reportedly the ship that called on Ukrainian soldiers stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender in a standoff. In a widely circulated recording, a soldier responded: “Russian warship, go (expletive) yourself.” The Associated Press could not independently verify the incident, but Ukraine and its supporters consider it an iconic moment of defiance. The country recently unveiled a postage stamp commemorating it. The news of the flagship overshadowed Russian claims of advances in the southern port city of Mariupol, where Moscow's forces have been battling the Ukrainians since the early days of the invasion in some of the heaviest fighting of the war — at a horrific cost to civilians. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Wednesday that 1,026 Ukrainian troops surrendered at a metals factory in the city. But Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, rejected the claim, telling Current Time TV that “the battle over the seaport is still ongoing today.” It was unclear how many forces were still defending Mariupol. Russian state television broadcast footage that it said was from Mariupol showing dozens of men in camouflage walking with their hands up and carrying others on stretchers. One man held a white flag. Mariupol has been the scene of the some the war's worst suffering. Dwindling numbers of Ukrainian defenders are holding out against a siege that has trapped well over 100,000 civilians in desperate need of food, water and heating. David Beasley, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, told AP in an interview Thursday that people are being “starved to death” in the besieged city. Mariupol’s mayor said this week that more than 10,000 civilians had died and the death toll could surpass 20,000, after weeks of attacks and privation left bodies “carpeted through the streets.” Mariupol's capture is critical for Russia because it would allow its forces in the south, which came up through the annexed Crimean Peninsula, to fully link up with troops in the Donbas region, Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland and the target of the coming offensive. The Russian military continues to move helicopters and other equipment together for such an effort, according to a senior U.S. defense official, and it will likely add more ground combat units “over coming days.” But it’s still unclear when Russia could launch a bigger offensive in the Donbas. Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukraine in the Donbas since 2014, the same year Russia seized Crimea. Russia has recognized the independence of the rebel regions in the Donbas. The loss of the Moskva could delay any new, wide-ranging offensive. Maksym Marchenko, the governor of the Odesa region, across the Black Sea to the northwest of Sevastopol, said the Ukrainians struck the ship with two Neptune missiles and caused “serious damage.” Russia’s Defense Ministry said ammunition on board detonated as a result of a fire, without saying what caused the blaze. It said the “main missile weapons” were not damaged. In addition to the cruise missiles, the warship also had air-defense missiles and other guns. The Neptune is an anti-ship missile that was recently developed by Ukraine and based on an earlier Soviet design. The launchers are mounted on trucks stationed near the coast, and, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, the missiles can hit targets up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) away. That would have put the Moskva within range, based on where it was when the fire began. Launched as the Slava in 1979, the cruiser saw service in the Cold War and during conflicts in Georgia and Syria, and helped conduct peacetime scientific research with the United States. During the Cold War, it carried nuclear weapons. In 1989, the Slava was supposed to host a meeting off Malta between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President George H.W. Bush, but gale-force winds moved the talks to the docked cruiser Maxim Gorky. On Thursday, other Russian ships that were also in the northern Black Sea moved further south after the Moskva caught fire, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments. Before the Moskva sank, Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister, told AP its removal would mean “we can only have a sigh of relief.” While the U.S. was not able to confirm Ukraine’s claims of striking the warship, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan called it “a big blow to Russia."" “They’ve had to kind of choose between two stories: One story is that it was just incompetence, and the other was that they came under attack, and neither is a particularly good outcome for them,” Sullivan told the Economic Club of Washington. Russia invaded on Feb. 24 and has lost potentially thousands of fighters. The conflict has killed untold numbers of Ukrainian civilians and forced millions more to flee. It has also further inflated prices at grocery stores and gasoline pumps, while dragging on the global economy. The head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the war helped push the organization to downgrade economic forecasts for 143 countries. Also Thursday, Russian authorities accused Ukraine of sending two low-flying military helicopters some 11 kilometers (7 miles) across the border and firing on residential buildings in the village of Klimovo, in Russia's Bryansk region. Russia’s Investigative Committee said seven people, including a toddler, were wounded. Russia’s state security service had earlier said Ukrainian forces fired mortar rounds at a border post in Bryansk as refugees were crossing, forcing them to flee. The reports could not be independently verified. Earlier this month, Ukrainian security officials denied that Kyiv was behind an air strike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, some 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the border. ——— Associated Press journalists around the world contributed to this report. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"More than 900 bodies of civilians were discovered in the Kyiv region following the withdrawal of Russian forces KYIV, Ukraine -- More than 900 civilian bodies have been discovered in the region surrounding the Ukrainian capital following the withdrawal of Russian forces — most of them fatally shot, police said Friday, an indication that many people were ""simply executed.” The jarring numbers emerged shortly after Russia’s Defense Ministry promised to step up missile attacks on Kyiv in response to Ukraine’s alleged aggression on Russian territory. That ominous warning followed the stunning loss of Moscow's flagship in the Black Sea, which a senior U.S. defense official said Friday was indeed hit by at least one Ukrainian missile. Around Kyiv, Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv’s regional police force, said bodies were abandoned in the streets or given temporary burials. He cited police data indicating that 95% died from gunshot wounds. “Consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,” Nebytov said. More bodies are being found every day, under rubble and in mass graves, he added. The largest number of victims were found in Bucha, where there were more than 350, he said. According to Nebytov, utilities workers in Bucha gathered and buried bodies in the Kyiv suburb while it remained under Russian control. Russian troops, he added, were “tracking down” people who expressed strong pro-Ukrainian views. More damage could be on the way for Kyiv after Russian authorities accused Ukraine of wounding seven people and damaging about 100 residential buildings with airstrikes in Bryansk, a region bordering Ukraine. Authorities in another border region of Russia also reported Ukrainian shelling Thursday. “The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. In Kyiv, a renewed bombardment could mean a return to the steady wail of air raid sirens heard during the early days of the invasion and to fearful nights sheltering in subway stations. Tentative signs of pre-war life have resurfaced in the capital after Russian troops failed to capture the city and retreated to concentrate on eastern Ukraine, leaving behind evidence of possible war crimes. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed striking targets in Russia, and the reports could not be independently verified. However, Ukrainian officials said their forces did strike a key Russian warship with missiles. And after more than a day of the Pentagon saying it could not confirm the claim, a senior U.S. defense official said it now believes the Moskva was hit Wednesday by at least one, and probably two, missiles, creating the large fire aboard. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. The guided-missile cruiser Moskva, named for the Russian capital, then sank while being towed to port Thursday after suffering heavy damage. Though Moscow did not acknowledge any attack, the loss of the ship represents an important victory for Ukraine and a symbolic defeat for Russia. The Moskva had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles. The last time a warship as large as the Moskva sank in combat was 1982. A British submarine torpedoed an Argentine navy cruiser called the ARA General Belgrano during the Falklands War, killing over 300 sailors. The sinking of the Russian warship reduces Russia’s firepower in the Black Sea, although military analysts disagreed on the event's significance to the course of the war. Either way, the loss was viewed as emblematic of Moscow's fortunes in a seven-week invasion widely seen as a historic blunder following the retreat from the Kyiv region and much of northern Ukraine. “A ‘flagship’ russian warship is a worthy diving site. We have one more diving spot in the Black Sea now. Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov tweeted Friday in a boast. In his nightly address Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainians they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.” Russia's warning of renewed airstrikes did not stop Kyiv residents from taking advantage of a sunny and slightly warmer spring day as the weekend approached. More people than usual were out on the streets Friday, walking dogs, riding electric scooters and strolling hand in hand. In one central park, a small group of people including a woman draped in a Ukrainian flag danced to the music of a portable speaker. Residents reported hearing explosions in parts of Kyiv overnight, but it was not clear what sites were targeted. News about the Moskva overshadowed Russian claims of advances in the southern port city of Mariupol, which Moscow's forces have blockaded since the early days of the invasion. Dwindling numbers of Ukrainian defenders have held out against a siege that has come at a horrific cost to trapped and starving civilians. Mariupol’s mayor said this week that more than 10,000 civilians had died and the death toll could surpass 20,000. Other Ukrainian officials have said they expect to find evidence in Mariupol of atrocities against civilians like the ones discovered in Bucha and other towns outside Kyiv. The Mariupol City Council said Friday that locals reported seeing Russian troops digging up bodies that were buried in residential courtyards and not allowing new burials “of people killed by them.” ""Why the exhumation is being carried out and where the bodies will be taken is unknown,” the council said on the Telegram messaging app. Mariupol’s capture would allow Russian forces in the south, which came up through the annexed Crimean Peninsula, to fully link up with troops in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland and the target of the looming offensive. Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas since 2014, the same year Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine. Russia has recognized the independence of two rebel-held areas of the region. Although it's not certain when Russia will launch the full-scale campaign, a regional Ukrainian official said Friday that seven people died and 27 were injured after Russian forces opened fire on buses carrying civilians in the village of Borovaya, near the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The claim could not be independently verified. Dmytro Chubenko, a spokesman for the regional prosecutor’s office, told Ukraine’s Suspilne news website, that Ukrainian authorities had opened criminal proceedings in connection with a suspected “violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with premeditated murder.” A large explosion also struck the eastern city of Kramatorsk, where a missile strike on a train station a week earlier killed more than 50 people as thousands heeding warnings to evacuate the Donbas area waited to leave. Associated Press journalists in Kramatorsk heard the sound of a rocket or missile and then the blast, followed by sirens wailing Friday. It was not immediately clear what was hit or whether there were casualties. A day earlier, a factory in the same city was hit by an airstrike. The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that Russian strikes in the Kharkiv region “liquidated a squad of mercenaries from a Polish private military company” of up to 30 people and “liberated” an iron and steel factor in Mariupol. The claims could not be independently verified. On Thursday, the Defense Ministry explained the damage to the Moskva by saying that a fire had caused ammunition on board to detonate. Apart from the cruise missiles, the Moskva also carried air-defense missiles and other guns. The ministry did not say what might have caused the blaze but reported that the crew, which usually numbers about 500, abandoned the vessel. It was not clear if there were any casualties. Maksym Marchenko, governor of Ukraine's Black Sea region of Odesa, said Ukrainian forces struck the Moskva with two Neptune missiles and caused “serious damage.” The Neptune is an anti-ship missile recently developed by Ukraine based on an earlier Soviet design. ——— Fisch reported from Kramatorsk.

"Under relentless bombardment and a Russian blockade, the key port of Mariupol is holding out, but weapons and supplies shortages could weaken the resistance that has thwarted the Kremlin’s invasion plans Ukraine says 30 prisoners of war will be returned as part of an exchange with Russia  LVIV, Ukraine -- Under relentless bombardment and a Russian blockade, the key port of Mariupol is holding out, but weapons and supplies shortages could weaken the resistance that has thwarted the Kremlin's invasion plans. More than six weeks after the Russian siege began, Ukrainian troops are continuing to fight the vastly superior Russian forces in ferocious battles amid the ruins of what once was a bustling city on the Sea of Azov. The mayor says an estimated 120,000 people remain in the city, out of Mariupol’s prewar population of about 450,000. The Ukrainians' fight has scuttled Moscow's designs, tying up significant Russian forces and delaying a planned offensive in eastern Ukraine's industrial heartland, Donbas. The Kremlin hopes an attack in the east could reverse the battlefield fortunes for Russia after a humiliating failure to quickly storm the capital, Kyiv. Mariupol has been a key objective for Russia since the start of the Feb. 24 invasion. Capturing the city would allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 and deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, a spokesman for Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, described the situation in Mariupol as “complicated,” saying fighting is continuing in industrial areas and the port, and that Russia for the first time used a Tu-22?3 long-range bomber to attack the city. The giant Azovstal steel mill and other plants have been heavily damaged by the Russian bombardment that has flattened much of Mariupol, indiscriminately hitting homes, hospitals and other public buildings and killing thousands. The victims include about 300 people killed in last month's Russian airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater that was being used as a shelter and had the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the pavement outside to ward off aerial attack. Mayor Vadym Boychenko told The Associated Press that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol with bodies “carpeted through the streets.” He said the Russians deployed mobile cremation equipment to methodically dispose of the bodies in order to hide evidence of the massacre and prevent international organizations from documenting ""the horror the Russian army is responsible for.” The bodies of more than 900 civilians have been found in the region surrounding Kyiv following the withdrawal of Russian forces, said Andriy Nebytov, head of the regional police force, adding that many were “simply executed.” The number of dead is double what was announced nearly two weeks ago, a discovery that has fueled global outrage and accusations from Ukrainians and the West that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine. Moscow deployed fighters from Chechnya, known for their ferocity, to wage street battles in Mariupol. Chechnya’s Moscow-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has repeatedly boasted on his messaging app channel about defeating Ukrainians in Mariupol, but the fight has continued. Boychenko said several Ukrainian units are still fighting in Mariupol, including the 36th Marine Brigade, Interior Ministry troops, border guards and the national guard's Azov Regiment, which Russia singles out as a particular villain because of its far-right ideology. The Azov Regiment, a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country’s most capable units, is defending the Azovstal plant that covers an area of nearly 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles). It has taken advantage of the plant's sprawling network of concrete buildings and underground facilities to repel continuous Russian attacks. The 36th Marine Brigade was maintaining defensive positions at the Azovmash and Zavod Ilyicha factories until it ran out of supplies and ammunition and made a desperate attempt to break through the Russian blockade earlier this week. In a post on the brigade's Facebook page, one of its officers described how “for more than a month, the marines have been fighting without replenishing ammunition, food and water supplies.” “The wounded accounted for nearly a half of the brigade's strength, but those who still had their limbs and were capable of walking reported back to duty,"" it said. Boychenko said that some of the marines managed to join the Azov regiment, while others were captured by the Russians. He didn't give any numbers. The Russian military said Thursday that a total of 1,160 Ukrainian marines surrendered this week, a claim that couldn't be independently verified. As the Ukrainian troops continue to offer fierce resistance in Mariupol, fears have grown that the exasperated Russians could resort to chemical weapons to deal with the remaining pockets of resistance at the Azovstal plant and other areas of the city. Eduard Basurin, a Russia-allied separatist official in eastern Ukraine, appeared to call for that Monday, telling Russian state TV that the Russia-backed forces should block all the exits out of the factory and then ""use chemical troops to smoke them out of there.” He later said that no chemical weapons were used. The Azov Regiment claimed Monday, without providing evidence, that a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on its positions but inflicted no serious injuries. A Ukrainian defense official said the attack possibly involved phosphorus munitions. Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russians have blocked humanitarian convoys from reaching Mariupol, keeping it without food, water and power since the siege started. The Russian troops have turned back buses sent to evacuate residents, but about 150,000 have been able to flee the city in their own vehicles. Boychenko said at least 33,500, and, possibly, up to 50,000 Mariupol residents have been taken to “filtration camps” in the separatist-controlled east before being forcibly sent to distant, economically depressed areas in Russia. Mariupol has seen communications cut since the start of the siege, and as the Russians moved to capture sections of the city they launched radio broadcasts to brainwash the population. “They unleashed propaganda, telling people that Kyiv and other cities have been captured and they have been abandoned,” Boychenko said. The continuing fighting has forced the Russian military to keep a significant number of troops in the city, delaying the eastern offensive. “As long as the street fighting is going on, Russia can't remove troops from Mariupol and deploy them to other areas, including Donbas,” Oleh Zhdanov, an independent military expert, told the AP. “The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are still fulfilling their main task by diverting the Russian forces from other areas. Mariupol remains a major symbol of the Ukrainian resistance."" ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"Russian forces have resumed scattered attacks on Kyiv, western Ukraine and beyond after warning that it planned to step up missile strikes on the capital KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces resumed scattered attacks on Kyiv, western Ukraine and beyond Saturday in an explosive reminder to Ukrainians and their Western supporters that the whole country remains under threat despite Russia’s pivot toward mounting a new offensive in the east. Stung by the loss of its Black Sea flagship and indignant over what it alleged were Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, Russia's military command had warned a day earlier of renewed attacks on Ukraine's capital and said it was targeting military sites. Associated Press reporters documented civilian deaths in strikes this week on the eastern city of Kharkiv, and each day brings new discoveries of civilian victims in a war that has shattered European security. In the Kyiv region alone, Ukrainian authorities have reported finding the bodies of more than 900 civilians, most shot dead, after Russian troops retreated two weeks ago. Smoke rose early Saturday from eastern Kyiv as Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported a strike on the the city's Darnytski district. He said rescuers and paramedics were at the scene, and information about possible deaths would be provided later. The mayor advised residents who fled the city earlier in the war not to return for their safety. It was not immediately clear from the ground what was hit in the attack. Darnytskyi is a sprawling district on the southeastern edge of the capital, containing a mixture of Soviet-style apartment blocks, newer shipping centers and big-box retail outlets, industrial areas and railyards. The spokesman for Russia's Defense Ministry said Russian forces used “air-launched high-precision long-range weapons” to target an armored vehicle plant in Kyiv. He didn’t specify where exactly the plant in Kyiv is located, but there is one in the Darnytskyi district. It was the second strike in the Kyiv area in two days. Another hit a missile plant on Friday as tentative signs of prewar life began to resurface in the capital after Russian troops failed to capture the city and withdrew to concentrate on lauching a full-scale assault in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv was not the only target Saturday. In eastern Ukraine, an explosion believed to be caused by a missile struck Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, according to firefighters and AP journalists at the scene. The strike near an outdoor market along with residential and industrial buildings killed one person and wounded at least 18, according to rescue workers who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information Meanwhile, the governor of the Lviv region in western Ukraine – far from the Russian border and an area long seen as a safe zone – reported airstrikes on the region by Russian Su-35 aircraft that took off from neighboring Belarus. Maksym Kozytskyy didn’t provide details about possible casualties or damage. Fighting continued in the pummeled southern port city of Mariupol, where locals reported seeing Russian troops digging up bodies. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the shelling of a residential area killed seven people, including a 7-month-old child, and wounded 34, according to regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian troops occupying parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south of terrorizing civilians and hunting for anyone who served in Ukraine’s military or government. “The occupiers think this will make it easier for them to control this territory. But they are very wrong. They are fooling themselves,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “Russia’s problem is that it is not accepted — and never will be accepted — by the entire Ukrainian people. Russia has lost Ukraine forever.” Officials think 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war, Zelenskyy told CNN in an interview. He said about 10,000 have been injured and it’s “hard to say how many will survive.” The United Nations' human rights office said it has confirmed the deaths of 1,982 civilians but cautioned that the figure does not include people killed in blockaded cities like Mariupol and the actual number is almost sure to be considerably higher. Russia's warning of stepped-up attacks on the capital came after Russian authorities accused Ukraine on Thursday of wounding seven people and damaging about 100 residential buildings with airstrikes in Bryansk, a region bordering Ukraine. Authorities in another border region of Russia also reported Ukrainian shelling. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed striking targets in Russia, and the reports could not be independently verified. However, Ukrainian officials did strike a key Russian warship with missiles earlier this week, in an important victory for Ukraine and symbolic defeat for Russia. A senior U.S. defense official said the U.S. believes the Moskva was hit by at least one Neptune anti-ship missile. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. The Moskva, named for the Russian capital, sank while being towed to port Thursday after taking heavy damage. Moscow did not acknowledge any attack, saying only that a fire had detonated ammunition on board. The sinking reduces Russia’s firepower in the Black Sea and seemed to symbolize Moscow’s fortunes in an eight-week invasion widely seen as a historic blunder following the Russian retreat from the Kyiv region and much of northern Ukraine. After the withdrawal, bodies were abandoned in the streets of towns around Kyiv or given temporary burials. Andriy Nebytov, who heads the region’s police force, cited police data indicating 95% died from gunshot wounds. “Consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,” Nebytov said. More bodies are being found every day under rubble and in mass graves, he added, with the largest number found in Bucha, more than 350. According to Nebytov, utility workers gathered and buried bodies in the Kyiv suburb while it remained under Russian control.

"Several businesses and residents have filed suit in state court in Pennsylvania seeking to overturn Philadelphia’s renewed indoor mask mandate scheduled to be enforced beginning Monday amid a surge in COVID-19 infections Philadelphia brings back indoor mask mandate as more states report COVID infections PHILADELPHIA -- Several businesses and residents have filed suit in state court in Pennsylvania seeking to overturn Philadelphia's renewed indoor mask mandate scheduled to be enforced beginning Monday in an effort to halt a surge in COVID-19 infections. The lawsuit, filed in Commonwealth Court on Saturday, said Philadelphia lacks the authority to impose such a mandate. Philadelphia earlier this week became the first major U.S. city to reinstate its indoor mask mandate after reporting a sharp increase in coronavirus infections, with the city’s top health official saying she wanted to forestall a potential new wave driven by an omicron subvariant. Attorney Thomas W. King III, who was among those involved in last year's successful challenge to the statewide mask mandate in schools, said the city's emergency order went against recommendations of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and “imposed a renegade standard unfound anywhere else in the world."" The suit accuses city health officials of having “usurped the power and authority"" of state lawmakers, the state department of health and the state advisory health board. Kevin Lessard, communications director of the Philadelphia mayor’s office, said officials were “unable to comment on this particular case” but cited a court’s denial of an emergency motion by another plaintiff for a preliminary injunction against the mandate. Lessard said “the courts once again confirmed that city has both the legal authority and requisite flexibility to enact the precautionary measures necessary to control the spread of COVID-19.” Most states and cities dropped their masking requirements in February and early March following new guidelines from the CDC that put less focus on case counts and more on hospital capacity and said most Americans could safely take off their masks. Philadelphia had ended its indoor mask mandate March 2. But on Monday Dr. Cheryl Bettigole, the health commissioner, cited a more than 50% rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases in 10 days, the threshold at which the city’s guidelines call for people to wear masks indoors. “If we fail to act now, knowing that every previous wave of infections has been followed by a wave of hospitalizations, and then a wave of deaths, it will be too late for many of our residents,” Bettigole said. Health inspectors are to begin enforcing the mask mandate at city businesses on Monday. The restaurant industry pushed back against the renewed mandate, saying workers will bear the brunt of customer anger over the new rules. The state Supreme Court in December ruled that the governor's administration had no legal authority to require masks in Pennsylvania’s schools and child care centers, citing state lawmakers' elimination of an emergency disaster declaration. The 6-0 ruling said state law gives health officials broad authority to protect public health but doesn't permit the department “to act by whim or fiat in all matters concerning disease.”",6
"U.S. Army trainers are using lessons learned from the Russian war against Ukraine as they prepare soldiers for future fights against a major adversary such as Russia or China FORT IRWIN, Calif. -- In the dusty California desert, U.S. Army trainers are already using lessons learned from Russia's war against Ukraine as they prepare soldiers for future fights against a major adversary such as Russia or China. The role-players in this month's exercise at the National Training Center speak Russian. The enemy force that controls the fictional town of Ujen is using a steady stream of social media posts to make false accusations against the American brigade preparing to attack. In the coming weeks, the planned training scenario for the next brigade coming in will focus on how to battle an enemy willing to destroy a city with rocket and missile fire in order to conquer it. If the images seem familiar, they are, playing out on televisions and websites worldwide right now as Russian forces pound Ukrainian cities with airstrikes, killing scores of civilians. The information war on social media has showcased impassioned nightly speeches by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Russian efforts to accuse Ukraine's forces of faking mass killings in towns such as Bucha — massacres that the West blames on Moscow's troops. “I think right now the whole Army is really looking at what’s happening in Ukraine and trying to learn lessons,” said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Those lessons, she said, range from Russia's equipment and logistics troubles to communications and use of the internet. “The Russia-Ukraine experience is a very powerful illustration for our Army of how important the information domain is going to be,"" said Wormuth, who spent two days at the training center in the Mojave Desert watching an Army brigade wage war against the fictional “Denovian” forces. ""We’ve been talking about that for about five years. But really seeing it and seeing the way Zelenskyy has been incredibly powerful. ... This is a world war that the actual world can see and watch in real time. ” At the center, the commander, Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor, and his staff have ripped pages out of the Russian playbook to ensure that U.S. soldiers are ready to fight and win against a sophisticated near-peer enemy. It's a common tool. For example, his base and the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana both shifted to counterinsurgency training during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. And the military services have focused other training on how to fight in cold weather — mimicking conditions in Russia or North Korea. But these latest changes have happened quickly in the early months after Russia invaded Ukraine. About 4,500 soldiers from 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, are out in the vast desert training area at Fort Irwin, where they will spend two weeks fighting the NTC's resident 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which acts as the enemy military. Soldiers from the regiment — known as Blackhorse — are arrayed in and around Ujen, which also includes role-players acting as the locals. As the sun was rising earlier this past week, Army Col. Ian Palmer, the brigade commander, stood on Crash Hill, on the outskirts of the town, preparing his soldiers to launch an attack. Lines of tanks spread out in the distance. Heavy winds the night before hampered his progress, so the attack was a bit behind. He said the exercise is using more drones by the friendly and enemy forces, both for surveillance and attacks. So his forces are trying to use camouflage and tuck into the terrain to stay out of sight. ""You know if you can be seen, you can be shot, where ever you are,” he said. Down in the makeshift town, the opposition forces are confident they can hold off Palmer's brigade despite the size difference. The Denovians only have about 1,350 forces, but they are throwing everything they have at the brigade, from jamming and other electronic warfare to insurgency attacks and propaganda. The role-players have their phones ready to film and post quickly to social media. The Denovian forces want to portray the unit in the worst possible light, said Taylor, and constantly twist the narrative on social media so Palmer's troops realize they are in a battle for the truth. That's a challenge, he said, because “when I've got a bunch of casualties and I’m getting overrun on my left flank and my supply trains aren’t where they need to be and I can’t find the bulldozers, it’s hard to think about something that someone said about me on Twitter."" The training goal, said Taylor, is teaching the brigades that come in how to fuse all elements of their combat power into a coordinated assault. “Everyone can play an instrument, but it's about making music — bringing it all together in a synchronized fashion. And what you saw today was the artillery was doing the artillery thing, the aviation was doing the aviation thing and the maneuver guys were doing the maneuver thing. But part of the delay in their assault on the town was they couldn’t synchronize those three,"" he said. Again, they can look to Ukraine to see how Russia failed to do that in the early weeks of the war. U.S. leaders repeatedly noted that in Russia's initial multipronged assault in Ukraine, commanders consistently failed to provide the airstrikes and support their ground troops needed to move into key cities such as Kyiv. That failure led to Russian troops bombing the cities from the outskirts, hitting hospitals, apartment buildings and other structures, and killing civilians. So when the next brigade arrives as the training center, Taylor said it will face an enemy on board with doing just that. “We will be very focused on how to fight against an adversary that is willing to destroy infrastructure because that's how we think our adversaries will fight,"" Taylor said. ""We’ve got to be prepared for urban combat where we have an adversary that is indiscriminately firing artillery.” Wormuth, the Army secretary, said seeing the training also underscored other lessons the U.S. is taking from the war in Ukraine. “As we’re watching what’s happening to the Russians now, it’s informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,” she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and the terrain in Europe is muddier, not like the hard-packed sand of the desert. The Army, she said, has to determine “what’s the right balance between the mobility of a tank, the survivability of a tank and the lethality of a tank? If you want to make it more mobile, you make it lighter, but that makes it less survivable. And so you have to decide where you’re going to take risks.” ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Follow Lolita C.

"At least 50 shots were fired inside the home, where 200 people were partying. At least 2 killed in Pittsburgh house party shooting  Two teenagers were killed and at least eight people were wounded when a barrage of 50 gunshots broke out early Sunday inside a Pittsburgh Airbnb rental house, where police said roughly 200 people were having a party. Some escaped the gunfire by jumping out of windows. The shooting marked the third time in nine days that gunfire erupted during parties being held at Airbnb rentals, including one near Sacramento, California, which left a teen dead, and another that rocked a suburban Houston residential neighborhood. The Pittsburgh shooting unfolded Sunday around 12:30 a.m., when police were notified of multiple ShotSpotter gunfire-detection alerts in the East Allegheny neighborhood on the city's North Side, according to the Pittsburgh Police Department. Cellphone video taken from inside the packed house and obtained by ABC News captured the screams and panic of party-goers rushing to get out of the residence, some tripping and falling down a staircase. In the footage, someone is heard shouting: ""He's got a gun!"" and ""We got to go!"" As apparent gunfire sounded, someone yelled: ""They're shooting!"" The shouts were followed by screams. Victims suffering from bullet wounds were found near the home and taken to hospitals by ambulance, police said. Other gunshot victims were taken to area hospitals in private cars, including two juveniles who were pronounced dead upon arriving at emergency rooms, authorities said. A total of 10 people were shot, including the two slain teenagers, police said. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office identified the deceased as Mathew Steffy-Ross and Jaiden Brown, both 17. Several other victims suffered broken bones and cuts fleeing the chaotic scene, according to police. Police said a preliminary investigation found that the shooting occurred during a large party being held at the short-term rental property, ""with as many as 200 people in attendance, many of them underage."" ""As many as 50 rounds were fired inside, prompting some party-goers to jump out the windows, sustaining injuries such as broken bones and lacerations,"" police said in a statement Sunday. ""Several more shots were fired outside the home."" No arrests have been made, and detectives are combing over evidence found at eight different crime scenes in a radius of several blocks around the Airbnb house. Detectives are also reviewing security video in an effort to identify suspects. During a press conference Sunday, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said the gunfire started after an ""altercation"" and confirmed that multiple shooters engaged in a gunfight. He said that in addition to the gunshot victims, five other people were injured from either jumping out of windows or falling down stairs while taking cover. ""It is our top priority to find out who did this and get them off the street,"" Schubert told reporters. He noted that the ""vast majority"" of people at the party were juveniles. ""This is something that shouldn’t have happened. This goes back to having too many guns -- too many illegal guns -- on the streets. Too many people who have access to these illegal weapons,"" he added. ""Innocent people were struck… We’re sick about it, and we’re gonna do everything we can to get those responsible for it."" Shell casings collected at the scene indicate multiple weapons were fired, including rifles, a police commander told ABC affiliate station WTAE in Pittsburgh. ""We share the Pittsburgh community’s outrage regarding this tragic gun violence. Our hearts go out to all who were impacted -- including loved ones of those who lost their lives, injured victims and neighbors,"" Airbnb told ABC News in a statement Sunday. ""Airbnb strictly bans parties, and we condemn the behavior that is alleged to have prompted this criminal gun violence."" Airbnb said the person who booked the house has been issued a lifetime ban from Airbnb. The company confirmed that an ""unauthorized party"" was thrown without the knowledge or consent of the house host, who specifically stated in the listing page that no parties were allowed and that any evidence of a party would result in a $500 fee. ""We will be considering all legal options to hold this person accountable,"" Airbnb's statement said, adding that the company is cooperating with the Pittsburgh Police Department's investigation. Addressing allegations that many of those attending the party were minors, the company said, ""we can confirm that users must be 18 or above to create an Airbnb account."" The company also noted that its CEO, Brian Chesky, has joined a coalition of CEOs nationwide calling for stricter gun control measures to get illegal firearms off the streets. Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said in a statement Sunday that police were using all available resources to find those responsible for the shooting and added that members of the community had contacted the investigators with information on the episode. According to Gainey, the shooting came as Pittsburgh police and city leaders have been been working on a plan in the past several weeks to address gun violence in the city.  He said a special meeting of public safety and key community members is being scheduled to discuss a citywide effort to combat gun violence. ""The time is now for us to move with a sense of urgency to bring justice to the victims and peace to our city,"" Gainey said. ""It is critical that we come together now to help reduce the violence currently happening while we begin to do the long-term work of ending the culture of violence that is enabling the senseless loss of life we are experiencing today. We must say no more and never again."" Anyone with information about the shooting can call the Pittsburgh Police Department's Major Crimes unit at 412-323-7161.",2
"Authorities say two minors are dead and at least nine others wounded in an early morning shooting at a Pittsburgh house party PITTSBURGH -- Shots fired at a house party in Pittsburgh early Sunday left two minors dead and at least nine more people injured, police said. The shooting happened around 12:30 a.m. during a party at a short-term rental property where there were more than 200 people inside — many of them underage, Pittsburgh police said in a news release. At least 11 people were being treated for gunshot wounds and two male victims died at the hospital, police said. Others were injured attempting to flee, with at least two people suffering broken bones by jumping out of the building’s windows, authorities said. Arriving officers reported hearing shots in the area and seeing several young people fleeing the area on foot and in vehicles, police said. Police said as many as 50 rounds were fired inside and several more were fired outside. Shell casings from rifles and pistols were found at the scene, Pittsburgh police commander John Fisher told WTAE-TV. Police are processing evidence at as many as eight separate crime scenes spanning a few blocks around the shooting scene, police said. “You have alcohol, you have underage people here and you have guns — that’s a deadly combination at any type of an event, and the end result is it’s a tragedy,” Fisher told WPXI-TV. The names of the two youths who died weren’t immediately released. No arrests were immediately reported and police didn't immediately release information about any suspects.",9
"The battered port city of Mariupol appears on the brink of falling to Russian forces after seven weeks under siege KYIV, Ukraine -- The shattered port city of Mariupol appeared on the brink of falling to the Russians on Sunday in what would give Moscow its biggest victory of the war yet and free up troops to take part in a potentially climactic battle for control of Ukraine’s industrial east. Russia estimated 2,500 Ukrainian fighters were holding out at a hulking steel plant in the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol, much of which has been reduced to a smoking ruin during a merciless seven-week siege. Moscow gave the city's defenders a surrender-or-die ultimatum with a midday deadline, saying those who laid down their arms were “guaranteed to keep their lives.” But the fighters ignored it, just as they rejected previous ultimatums. “We will fight absolutely to the end, to the win, in this war,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal vowed on ABC's “This Week.” He said Ukraine is prepared to end the war through diplomacy if possible, “but we do not have intention to surrender.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sent Easter greetings via Twitter, saying: ""The Lord’s Resurrection is a testimony to the victory of life over death, good over evil.” If Mariupol is captured, Russian forces there are expected to join an all-out offensive in the coming days for control of the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that the Kremlin is bent on taking after failing in its bid to seize Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. The relentless bombardment and street fighting in Mariupol have killed at least 21,000 people, by the Ukrainians' estimate. A maternity hospital was hit by a lethal Russian airstrike in the opening weeks of the war, and about 300 people were reported killed in the bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter. An estimated 100,000 remained in the city out of a prewar population of 450,000, trapped without food, water, heat or electricity in a siege that has made Mariupol the scene of some of the worst suffering of the war. ""All those who will continue resistance will be destroyed,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry's spokesman, said in announcing the latest ultimatum. He said intercepted communications indicated about 400 foreign mercenaries were holed up along with the Ukrainian troops at the Azovstal steel mill, which covers more than 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is laced with tunnels. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar described Mariupol as a “shield defending Ukraine” as Russian troops prepare for the battle in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists already control some territory. In a reminder that no part of the country is safe, Russian forces carried out missile strikes Sunday near Kyiv and elsewhere in an apparent effort to weaken Ukraine’s military capacity before the anticipated assault. After the humiliating sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet last week in what the Ukrainians boasted was a missile attack, the Kremlin had vowed to step up strikes on the capital. Russia said Sunday that it had attacked an ammunition plant near Kyiv overnight with precision-guided missiles, the third such strike in as many days. Explosions were reported overnight in Kramatorsk, the eastern city where rockets earlier this month killed at least 57 people at a train station crowded with civilians trying to evacuate ahead of the Russian offensive. A regional official in eastern Ukraine said at least two people were killed when Russian forces fired at residential buildings in the town of Zolote, near the front line in the Donbas. At least five people were killed by Russian shelling in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, on Sunday, regional officials said. The barrage slammed into apartment buildings and left the streets scattered with broken glass and other debris, including part of at least one rocket. Russia also said that its forces shot down two Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jets in the Kharkiv region and destroyed two Ukrainian command posts and a radar system for S-300 surface-to-air missiles in the city of Avdiivka, north of Donetsk city. Ukrainian officials did not immediately confirm the claimed losses. Malyar, the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, said the Russians continued to hit Mariupol with airstrikes and could be getting ready for an amphibious landing to reinforce their ground troops. Capturing the southern city on the Sea of Azov would allow Russia to fully secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and deprive Ukraine of a major port and its prized industrial assets. The looming offensive in the east, if successful, would give Russian President Vladimir Putin a vital piece of the country and a badly needed victory that he could sell to the Russian people amid the war's mounting casualties and the economic hardship caused by the West's sanctions. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who met with Putin in Moscow this week — the first European leader to do so since the invasion Feb. 24 — said the Russian president is “in his own war logic” on Ukraine. In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Nehammer said he thinks Putin believes he is winning the war, and “we have to look in his eyes and we have to confront him with that, what we see in Ukraine.’’ Without explicitly mentioning Putin’s decision to invade, Pope Francis made an anguished Easter Sunday plea for peace in Ukraine, decrying “this cruel and senseless war into which it was dragged.” ——— Chernov reported from Kharkiv.

"The Boston Marathon is back in the spring, where it belongs BOSTON -- The daffodils have sprouted, the fall foliage has all been raked away, and the Boston Marathon is back in the spring where it belongs. The world’s most prestigious marathon will return to the streets from Hopkinton to Copley Square on Monday, three years after the last Patriots' Day race and six months after its 125th edition was delayed, canceled and delayed again by the COVID-19 pandemic. “We went for a run this morning and I was like, ‘OK, this is what it’s supposed to be. This feels normal,’” 2018 winner Des Linden said last week. “The energy feels right back where we left off. So that was a nice reminder.” After a smaller and socially distanced field ran in October, more than 28,000 runners have signed up for Monday's 26.2-mile slog, including 11 former champions and what could be the fastest field ever. Also moving quickly: Organizers who had 30 months between the 2019 and ‘21 events and then just 139 days since the only fall race in Boston Marathon history. “And we can’t wait,” Boston Athletic Association President Tom Grilk said. Monday’s forecast calls for temperatures in the 50s with no rain, and only the possibility of a slight headwind late in the afternoon for the stragglers. TOP FIELD The women’s field is one of the strongest ever in Boston, with reigning Olympic gold medalist Peres Jepchirchir, London and New York winner Joyciline Jepkosgei, and Ethiopia’s Degitu Azimeraw all bringing personal bests under 2 hours, 18 minutes — two minutes faster than the Boston course record. Linden and Tokyo bronze medalist Molly Seidel are the top American contenders. Benson Kipruto of Kenya is attempting to become the first back-to-back Boston champion since Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot won three straight from 2006-08. Eight others have shown the speed to beat him, including Boston winners Lawrence Cherono (2019), Lemi Berhanu (’16) and Lelisa Desisa (’13, ’15). Colin Bennie, of Princeton, Massachusetts, and CJ Albertson, or Fresno, California, are back after finishing in the top 10 in October. PANDEMIC PROTOCOLS In October, participants were required to be vaccinated, tested, and masked whenever indoors. The race cut its field by more than one-third, and a rolling start was instituted to allow for social distancing on the course and in Hopkinton. Six months later, vaccinations (or an exemption) are required, but testing is optional. Masks are required on the buses that take athletes to the start, but the state's indoor mandate has been lifted. “We’re in a good place,” marathon medical director Aaron Baggish said. “Viral prevalence in the community is low, and we’ve done a good job weathering the storm.” TERRORISM WATCH The shooting on the New York City subway last week had Boston authorities redoubling their efforts to provide a safe environment for the athletes and fans on Patriots' Day. Nine years after the attacks at the marathon finish line that killed three people and injured hundreds more, a New York man shot 10 people in a Brooklyn subway car. Frank James, 62, was arrested the next day and is being held without bail. Authorities say there was no evidence linking James to a larger terror plot. At a Boston Marathon public safety briefing last week, local, state and federal officials said they were ready. “It’s all hands on deck for these major events,” MBTA Police Chief Kenneth Green said. “But every day, every regular day we’re prepared. We’re out there. We’re vigilant. We’re at work, and we’re visible. You don’t have the luxury to relax because any individual got caught on the subway somewhere else.” UKRAINE Residents or citizens of Ukraine who were registered for the race were offered a refund or deferral to a future race if they could not or did not want to run this year. “Whatever they want to do, they can do,” Grilk said. “Run this year, run next year. You want a puppy, whatever. There is no group we want to be more helpful to.” There were 44 Ukrainian citizens in the field, seven of them living abroad. However, residents of Russia and Belarus have been told they are not welcome. Citizens of the two countries living abroad remained eligible to run, but they cannot display their national flags or emblems. ——— More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP—Sports",9
"Ukrainian officials say Russian missiles hit the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, killing at least seven people LVIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces launched missile attacks on the western city of Lviv and pounded a multitude of other targets across Ukraine on Monday in what appeared to be an intensified bid to grind down the country’s defenses ahead of an all-out assault on the east. At least seven people were reported killed in Lviv, where plumes of thick black smoke rose over a city that has seen only sporadic attacks during almost two months of war and has become a haven for large numbers of civilians fleeing intense fighting elsewhere. To the Kremlin’s increasing anger, Lviv has also become a major conduit for NATO-supplied weapons and for foreign fighters joining the Ukrainian cause. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, meanwhile, vowed to “fight absolutely to the end” in strategically vital Mariupol, where the last known pocket of resistance in the seven-week siege consisted of Ukrainian fighters holed up in a sprawling steel plant. The holdouts ignored a surrender-or-die ultimatum from the Russians on Sunday. The governor of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyy, said the Russian missile strikes hit three military infrastructure facilities and an auto mechanic shop. He said the wounded included a child, and emergency teams battled fires caused by the attack. Lviv is the biggest city and a major transportation hub in western Ukraine. It sits roughly 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Poland, a NATO member. Russia has strongly complained about the increasing flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, and last week its Foreign Ministry issued a formal note of protest to the U.S. and its allies. On Russian state media, some anchors have charged that the supplies amount to direct Western engagement in the fight against Russia. Lviv has also been seen as a relatively safe place for the elderly, mothers and children trying to escape the war. But a hotel sheltering Ukrainians who had fled fighting in other parts of the country was among the buildings badly damaged, Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said. “The nightmare of war has caught up with us even in Lviv,"" said Lyudmila Turchak, who fled with two children from the eastern city of Kharkiv. ""There is no longer anywhere in Ukraine where we can feel safe.” A powerful explosion also rocked Vasylkiv, a town south of the capital of Kyiv that is home to a military airbase, according to residents. It was not immediately clear what was hit. Military analysts say Russia is increasing its strikes on weapons factories, railways and other infrastructure targets across Ukraine to wear down the country’s ability to resist a major ground offensive in the Donbas, Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking eastern industrial heartland. The Russian military said its missiles struck more than 20 military targets in eastern and central Ukraine in the past day, including ammunition depots, command headquarters and groups of troops and vehicles. It claimed its artillery hit an additional 315 Ukrainian targets and warplanes conducted 108 strikes on Ukrainian troops and military equipment. The claims could not be independently verified. Over the weekend, Russia also claimed to have destroyed Ukrainian air defense radar equipment. Gen. Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, told Sky News the strikes were part of a “softening-up” campaign by Russia ahead of a planned ground offensive in the Donbas. Ukraine’s government halted civilian evacuations for a second day on Monday, saying Russian forces were shelling and blocking the humanitarian corridors. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine had been negotiating passage from cities and towns in eastern and southeastern Ukraine, including Mariupol and other areas in the Donbas. The government of the Luhansk region in the Donbas said four civilians trying to flee were shot and killed by Russian forces. Vereshchuk said Russia could be prosecuted for war crimes over its refusal to allow civilians to leave Mariupol. “Your refusal to open these humanitarian corridors will in the future be a reason to prosecute all involved for war crimes,” she wrote on social media. The Russians, in turn, accused “neo-Nazi nationalists” in Mariupol of hampering the evacuation. Russia is bent on capturing the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists already control some territory, after its attempt to take the capital failed. “We are doing everything to ensure the defense” of eastern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address to the nation on Sunday. The looming offensive in the east, if successful, would give Russian President Vladimir Putin a badly needed victory to point to amid the war’s mounting casualties and the economic hardship caused by Western sanctions. The capture of Mariupol is seen as a key step in preparations for any eastern assault since it would free Russian troops up for that new campaign. The fall of the city on the Sea of Azov would also hand Russia its biggest victory of the war, giving it full control of a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014, and depriving Ukraine of a major port and its prized industrial assets. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar has described Mariupol as a “shield defending Ukraine."" The city has been reduced to rubble in the siege, but a few thousand fighters, by Russia's estimate, are holding on to the giant, 11-square-kilometer (4-square-mile) Azovstal steel mill. The relentless bombardment of Mariupol — including at a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians were sheltering — has combined with street fighting to kill at least 21,000 people, by Ukrainian estimates. An estimated 100,000 people remain in the city out of a prewar population of 450,000, trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. A pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who was arrested last week on a treason charge appeared in a video offering himself in exchange for the evacuation of Mariupol’s trapped defenders and civilians. Ukraine’s state security services posted the video of Viktor Medvedchuk, the former leader of a pro-Russian opposition party with personal ties to Putin. It was not clear whether Medvedchuk was speaking under duress. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was also hit by shelling Monday that killed at least three people, according to Associated Press journalists on the scene. One of the dead was a woman who appeared to be going out to collect water in the rain. She was found lying with a water canister and an umbrella by her side. Putin repeated his insistence that the Western sanctions “blitz” against Russia had failed. He said the West has not managed to “provoke panic in the markets, the collapse of the banking system and shortages in stores,” though he acknowledged a sharp increase in consumer prices in Russia, saying they rose 17.5%. ——— This story has been updated to correct the attribution on the first partial quote about fighting to the end to Ukraine’s prime minister, not president. ——— Associated Press journalists Nico Maounis and Philip Crowther in Lviv, Ukraine, and Adam Schreck in Vasylkiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report, as did other AP staff members around the world. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",4
"Reigning Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Boston Marathon women’s division by winning a see-saw sprint down Boylston Street On Location: April 18, 2022 BOSTON -- Reigning Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir capped the celebration of a half-century of women in the Boston Marathon with a finish to top them all. The 28-year-old Kenyan won a see-saw sprint in the final mile on Monday as the world's most prestigious 26.2-mile race returned to its traditional Patriots’ Day spot in the schedule for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. On the 50th anniversary of the first official women’s race, Jepchirchir traded places with Ethiopia’s Ababel Yeshaneh eight times in the final mile before pulling ahead for good on Boylston Street and finishing in 2 hours, 21 minutes, 1 seconds. “I was feeling she was strong. I pushed it,” said Jepchirchir, who earned $150,000 and the traditional gilded olive wreath. “I fell behind. But I didn’t lose hope.” Evans Chebet completed the Kenyan sweep, breaking free in the men's race with about four miles to go to win in 2:06:51. Gabriel Geay of Tanzania was second, 30 seconds back, and defending champion Benson Kipruto was third. American Daniel Romanchuk won his second career men’s wheelchair title in 1:26:58. Switzerland’s Manuela Schar won her second straight Boston crown and fourth overall, finishing in 1:41:08. Sharing a weekend with the Red Sox home opener — the city’s other sporting rite of spring — more than 28,000 runners returned to the streets from Hopkinton to Copley Square six months after a smaller and socially distanced event that was the only fall race in its 126-year history. Fans waved Ukrainian flags in support of the few dozen runners whose 26.2-mile run from Hopkinton to Copley Square was the easiest part of their journey. Athletes from Russia and Belarus were disinvited in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainians who were unable to make it to Boston were offered a deferral or refund. “Whatever they want to do, they can do,” Boston Athletic Association President Tom Grilk said. “Run this year, run next year. You want a puppy? Whatever. There is no group we want to be more helpful to.” Jepchirchir and Yeshaneh spent most of the morning running shoulder to shoulder — or even closer: In the first half, the Ethiopian's eyes wandered from the course and she drifted into Jepchirchir. She reached out to apologize, and the two clasped each other's arms as they continued on. “She's my best friend,” Jepchirchir said. Beaten, Yeshaneh finished four seconds back. Kenya's Mary Ngugi finished third for the second time in six months, following her podium in October after the 125th race was delayed, canceled and delayed again. This year's race marked the 50th anniversary of Nina Kuscsik's victory as the inaugural official women's winner. (But not the first woman to finish the race: That honor belongs to Bobbi Gibb, who first ran in 1966 among the unofficial runners known as bandits.) Valerie Rogosheske, who finished sixth in '72, said she had been planning to hide in the bushes and run as a bandit that year before women got the go-ahead a few weeks before the race. She was among five of the original eight women to return this year for the festivities, running alongside her daughters, and serving as the honorary starter for the women’s elite field. “There was just this feeling of, 'Boy, we’re going to do this. No one can drop out. There are eyes upon us,'"" she said at the starting line on Monday. “Many people didn’t think we should be running a marathon. So that’s why we really felt that pressure, but opportunity as well, to finish this marathon.”",2
"He said he told his wife to get away from the windows of their home. Neighbor recalls deadly Airbnb shooting In the aftermath of a mass shooting at an Airbnb rental house that left two 17-year-old boys dead and eight people wounded, neighbor Leonard Verdetto described what he said was ""rapid fire"" followed by panicked party-goers flooding out of the residence. The episode erupted early Sunday morning across the street from Verdetto's Pittsburgh home and was one of three mass shootings in the United States over the Easter weekend, including two in South Carolina at a mall and a restaurant. The Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings across the nation, has tallied 139 mass shootings in the country in the first 107 days of 2022. ""When we heard the bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, we looked out the window and people were running out the door and screaming, yelling, crying,"" Verdetto told ABC affiliated station WTAE in Pittsburgh of the shooting that broke at the Airbnb house being used for a party in his East Allegheny neighborhood on the city's North Side. When Verdetto's wife went to look out a window to see what the commotion was, he said he yelled, ""Get away from the window!"" ""I could see the flashing of the shots coming out the windows because we look across at the windows,"" Verdetto said. ""I said, 'Holy mackerel, that's really rapid fire.' I said, 'Man, with all that shooting there's got to be a lot of dead people over there. It was lucky it was only two."" More than 90 shots were fired, including 50 inside the home, where the Pittsburgh Police Department said more than 200 people were attending a party. Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said at a news conference Sunday that the gunfire started after an ""altercation"" and confirmed that multiple shooters engaged in a gunfight. Besides the 10 people shot, including the two slain teenagers, another five party-goers suffered broken bones and cuts attempting to escape the gunfire, some by jumping from windows, Schubert said. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office identified the deceased as Mathew Steffy-Ross and Jaiden Brown, both 17. No arrests have been made and investigators were working Monday to identify suspects. ""They all come tearing out and they were falling over, crying. There were a lot of young girls,"" Verdetto said. He added that prior to the shooting, he noticed mostly young people lined up outside the house. ""There was a long line getting into the building. I said, 'Wow, where are all them people going?'"" Verdetto said. ""And then I'd come back again and come back again and the line was still going and going. I said, 'I don't know how they get all them people in there.' And I mean, it was a lot of people in there."" The owner of the Airbnb rental has not been identified. The shooting marked the third time in nine days that gunfire erupted during parties being held at Airbnb rentals, including one near Sacramento, California, which left a teen dead, and another that rocked a suburban Houston residential neighborhood. Airbnb said a statement to ABC News that the person who booked the Pittsburgh house has been issued a lifetime ban from Airbnb. The company confirmed that an ""unauthorized party"" was thrown without the knowledge or consent of the house host, who specifically stated in the listing page that no parties were allowed and that any evidence of a party would result in a $500 fee. Airbnb said on Monday it is taking legal action against the person who booked the Pittsburgh rental. ""Airbnb strictly bans parties, and we condemn the behavior that is alleged to have prompted this criminal gun violence and the tragic loss of life. Yesterday we confirmed the booking guest has been issued a lifetime ban from Airbnb, and today we can confirm that we plan to pursue affirmative legal action against this individual,"" Airbnb said in a new statement on Monday, adding that the company is cooperating with the Pittsburgh Police Department's investigation. Following the shooting, Verdetto said his grandson pointed out numerous vehicles in the neighborhood with shattered windows, and walls of nearby homes and businesses pockmarked with bullet holes. ""I'm just glad I'm here,"" Verdetto said. ABC News' Victoria Arancio contributed to this report.",9
"Up to 12,000 troops could be used elsewhere, a U.S. defense official said. Russia intensifies attacks on eastern Ukraine The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 54. Russia 'shaping' the battlefield for renewed offensive  There are now 76 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) inside Ukraine, all of them in the south and east. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 soldiers. That's up from 65 BTGs last week, so as many 11,000 troops have crossed the border since then, the senior defense official said. Last week, the U.S. mostly saw support forces convoying into the Donbas region, but BTGs are Russia's primary fighting units. Artillery, helicopter support and command and control elements have continued to flow in. In a separate briefing, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Monday that while there is currently fighting in Donbas, as there has been for years, defense officials do not believe Russia's new offensive push has begun. ""We believe that the Russians are shaping and setting the conditions for future offensive operations,"" Kirby said. That shaping effort appears to be an attempt by Russia to avoid blunders it made during combat operations in northern Ukraine. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby said. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" While Russian forces are ""trying to set the conditions for more aggressive, more overt, and larger ground maneuvers in the Donbas,"" Kirby said Ukrainian troops are not sitting idle. ""We have seen indications in just the last few days that the Ukrainians not only have have defended bravely, but they have been able to secure certain villages and towns in the Donbas,"" Kirby said. There are another 22 or so BTGs still in Russia north of Ukraine, most likely refitting and resupplying after being depleted form earlier combat in northern Ukraine, according to a defense official. The official noted that if Russia takes Mariupol, it would free up close to another 12 BTGs (roughly 8,800-12,000 troops) that could be used for fighting elsewhere in the south or east. Mariupol Ukrainian forces continue fighting to push back Russian troops in Mariupol, according to the official. The city is still under threat of missile and artillery bombardment. Kyiv and lviv under long-range fire Russian long-range bombers have hit both Kyiv and Lviv with air-launched cruise missiles over the last couple of days, according to the official. ""Our initial assessment is that they were going after primarily military targets, or what they believed to be military targets,"" the official said. During his press briefing, Kirby said the U.S. is still assessing what the Russian's hit in the two cities, but added that most Russian airstrikes are being directed on the east and south of Ukraine, especially Mariupol. The Moskva The U.S. can't verify authenticity of videos purportedly showing Russia's Moskva cruiser sinking, ""but the images themselves comport with what we had assessed to be the damage done to the ship,"" the official said. The official said the U.S. was able to see Russian sailors board lifeboats before the ship sank, but could not confirm how many casualties there might have been. ""It's hard to look at the damage that was done without generally assuming that there were also casualties, that she lost sailors. How many, we just don't know,"" the official said. First shipments of new $800 million US aid package arrive  ""Based on the last $800 million that the President authorized that we just announced last week, already there have been four flights from the United States arriving into the theater just yesterday,"" the official said. US to train Ukrainians on artillery In coming days, the U.S. plans to facilitate training for Ukrainians on the howitzers it's sending them, according to the official. The 18 howitzers heading to Ukraine will come from a mix of U.S. Army and Marine Corps stocks. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",6
"The workers allege staffing shortages and a lack of PPE stockpiles. How doctors don and doff personal protective equipment More than 8,000 nurses and health care workers in Northern California are planning a one-day strike Monday over staffing and other COVID-19-related concerns. The employees of Sutter Health, a health delivery system headquartered in Sacramento, are planning to strike at 15 facilities -- including locations in Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Vallejo -- between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. According to a press release from the California Nurses' Association, a labor union, the workers are protesting concerns related to staffing shortages as well as health and safety protections they say are putting both patients and staff in danger. The CNA said the nurses voted to strike in March and alerted Sutter Health of the plans to picket 10 days in advance. ""We have tried repeatedly to address the chronic and widespread problem of short staffing that causes delays in care and potentially puts patients at risk, but hospital administrators continue to ignore us,"" Amy Erb, a critical care nurse who works for Sutter's California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, said in a statement. The statement continued, ""We have a moral and legal obligation to advocate for our patients. We advocate for them at the bedside, at the bargaining table, and if we have to, on the strike line."" Additionally, the workers alleged Sutter Health did not provide its workers with enough personal protective equipment at the beginning of the pandemic and has refused to invest in stockpiles, ignoring California's PPE stockpile law. Staff also said the health network has not been conducting contact tracing after positive cases are reported among staff. In addition to getting Sutter to address their concerns, the workers are attempting to negotiate higher salaries. Sutter Health told KCRA 3 in a statement it does offer competitive wages and pandemic protections. ""They resist having nurses directly involved in planning and implementation of policies that affect all of us during a pandemic,"" Renee Water, a neurotrauma intensive care unit nurse at Sutter, said in a statement. ""A fair contract is needed to retain experienced nurses, have sufficient staffing and training, and ensure we have the resources we need to provide safe and effective care for our patients"" The union said nurses and other health care workers have been negotiating with Sutter for a new contract since June 2021 with little advancement. Sutter sent a statement to ABC News, saying it was disappointed by the strike and referring to it as ""disruptive"" and ""costly."" ""By moving forward with today's costly and disruptive strike, union leadership has made it clear they are willing to put politics above patients and the nurses they represent -- despite the intervention of federal mediators and our willingness to bargain in good faith while under threat of a strike,"" the health network said. The statement continued, ""Our attention is on providing safe, high-quality care to the patients and communities we're honored to serve. We are confident in our ability to manage this disruption. We are hopeful CNA shares our desire to reach an agreement and enable our nurses to turn their focus back to the patients the union has asked them to walk away from.""",3
"The moves are a ""prelude"" to larger operations, a U.S. defense official said. Russia declares new phase of its ‘special operation’ underway The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 55. 'Limited' Russian offensive operations so far in eastern Ukraine The U.S. has seen ""limited"" Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk and south of Izium, but these are believed to be ""preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""These are actual ground offensives, and they are being supported, of course, by some long-range fires, mostly artillery, which is right out of the Russian doctrine,"" the official said. But while there is ongoing fighting in the region, a more devastating offensive is still in the works. ""You've seen comments by [Ukraine's] President Zelenskyy yesterday, and even for [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov, about this new offensive beginning ... We think that these ... are preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct. So, we're not pushing back on the notion that offensive operations have begun, but again, we think that this is a prelude of larger offensive operations that are potentially still in the offing here,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes Russia's military is working to learn from its mistakes fighting in the north, where it was plagued with logistical and supply problems, conducting what officials call ""shaping operations"" to set favorable conditions on the battlefield before beginning its new offensive in earnest. ""In other words, continue to reinforce, continue to make sure they have logistics and sustainment in place, continue to make sure that they have proper aviation and other enabling capability,"" the official said. Over the last 24 hours, two Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs), or up to 2,000 more combat troops, have been sent into Ukraine, according to the official. This brings the total to an estimated 78 BTGs inside the country, all in the south and east. About 75% of Putin's total combat power originally arrayed against Ukraine remains, according to the official. This takes into account all military capabilities, including troop casualties, destroyed vehicles and aircraft, and expended missiles. This is the lowest assessment we've heard out of the Pentagon. Fall of Mariupol and Donbas 'not inevitable'  ""People speak about this as if it's inevitable, that Mariupol is going to fall, that it's inevitable that Donbas will be taken by the Russians. We don't see it that way. And we're doing everything we can to make sure that it's not inevitable,"" the official said. With fighting concentrated around Donbas, Ukraine has to move aid coming in from the U.S. and others all the way across the country. ""Right now we know from our discussions with the Ukrainians that they are getting this materiel, it's getting into the hands of their fighters,"" the official said. But Russia aims to isolate Ukrainian forces in the east. ""Clearly what the Russians want to do is cut them off and to defeat them in the Donbas,"" the official said, reiterating that defeat is not inevitable. Ukraine has more operable planes than 2 weeks ago At a separate briefing later Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine currently has more operable military planes right now than it did two weeks ago because Ukraine has received additional aircraft as well as parts to get damaged planes flying again. Kirby was reticent to provide any details on where the parts and planes came from but stressed that they did not come from the U.S. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby said at the on-camera briefing at the Pentagon. “And that's not by accident, that's because other nations who had experience with those kinds of aircraft have been able to help them get more aircraft up and running,” said Kirby. ""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said. Russian missile strikes The U.S. assesses Russia has fired at least 1,670 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. The official noted that bad weather lowers visibility, making it harder for the U.S. to observe launches and other battlefield actions, so the actual number could be higher. Despite the recent airstrikes in Kyiv and Lviv, Russia's firepower is focused on Mariupol and Donbas.",6
"A federal judge struck down the CDC's mask mandate as ""unlawful."" Judge strikes down travel mask mandate Confusion abounded after a federal judge in Florida struck down the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's travel mask mandate Monday. The mandate, first announced in January 2021, required travelers to wear masks on airplanes, in airports and other travel hubs, and while riding public transit. But Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle for the Middle District of Florida wrote in her ruling that the mandate was ""unlawful"" and that the CDC exceeded its authority when the policy was implemented. While many Americans are excited, others are attempting to figure out what the new rules mean about their risk of contracting COVID-19 while in transit and how to limit their exposure to the virus. CDC still recommends wearing masks Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said even though the travel mask mandate has been lifted, it doesn't mean people aren't allowed to wear face coverings when traveling. In fact, he noted that the CDC still advises wearing masks in indoor public transportation settings. ""People should recognize that this does not mean the CDC is not recommending the masks in public,"" he said. ""So, I think people should pay attention to that advice."" The lifting of the mandate comes as cases rise in the U.S., in part due to the BA.2 variant, a highly transmissible subvariant of the original omicron variant. New COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have reached their highest point in more than a month, and in the last week, 34 states and territories have seen increases of about 10% or more. Ray said the combination of increasing cases and the lifting of mandates will result in more spread, so even people who are not high risk or are younger may want to consider still wearing masks when they travel. ""As long as infection rates seem to be rising, I think it's wise to think about protecting yourself even if you don't have special vulnerability,"" he said. What people at high risk for severe COVID-19 should consider The ruling also has implications for people who are at high risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death, including immunocompromised people, those with underlying conditions, older people and those who are pregnant. Currently, the CDC recommends these high-risk individuals wear a mask in public indoor spaces in areas with high transmission and to speak to their doctors about face coverings in areas with medium transmission. Ray said the mandate being lifted ""raises the temperature for risk"" for these groups and they may want to consider taking precautions. This could mean avoiding travel for the time being or making sure to wear a high-quality mask, such as an N95, when traveling to avoid infection. ""These people need to be that much more careful that they have a good mask, that they change it on a regular basis as recommended, that they take those measures, because others will be less likely to be wearing a mask and preventing spread,"" he said. Increased importance of testing  Ray also said now that the mandate has been lifted, it will be more important for people to get tested after traveling somewhere. He recommends that people take a rapid test after arriving at their destination and before they gather with others. ""We may want to make sure that we have rapid tests available because, right before the gathering, we can use those to mitigate the risk of transmission,"" Ray said. Ray added that testing ahead of a gathering should be essential when people at risk of severe COVID-19 or who are immunocompromised are in attendance. ""The importance of that increases when there are more vulnerable people and, of course, it's hard to just look at someone and tell whether or not they're vulnerable,"" he said. More long-term consequences  Another concern experts such as Ray have is that more people sitting in close proximity to each other unmasked on subways, trains or planes may result in more people who develop long-term problems from COVID-19 simply because more people will become infected. This could mean more people with ""long COVID,"" which occurs when patients who have recovered from the virus continue to experience symptoms weeks, or sometimes months or even years, after testing positive. Other problems include heart and kidney damage, blood clots or Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis, according to the Mayo Clinic. Ray said he thinks the U.S. can balance these concerns about more people developing long-term complications ""by being more cautious on a voluntary basis in the absence of the mandate."" He continued, ""It's of course possible that the immunity we've built up is going to mitigate those long-term complications, but we won't know that for some time, and making decisions looking backward is always hard.""

"Russia is attacking cities and towns in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland and pouring more forces into the country KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia assaulted cities and towns along a boomerang-shaped front hundreds of miles long and poured more troops into Ukraine on Tuesday in a potentially pivotal battle for control of the country's eastern industrial heartland of coal mines and factories. If successful, the Russian offensive in what is known as the Donbas would essentially slice Ukraine in two and give President Vladimir Putin a badly needed victory following the failed attempt by Moscow's forces to storm the capital, Kyiv, and heavier-than-expected casualties nearly two months into the war. The eastern cities of Kharkiv and Kramatorsk came under deadly attack. Russia also said it struck areas around Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro west of the Donbas with missiles. Multiple explosions were heard early Wednesday in the southern city of Mykolaiv, the regional governor said. A hospital was reported shelled earlier in the nearby town of Bashtanka. In Mariupol, the now-devastated port city in the Donbas, Ukrainian troops said the Russian military dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of a sprawling steel plant and hit a hospital where hundreds were staying. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Moscow's forces bombarded numerous Ukrainian military sites, including troop concentrations and missile-warhead storage depots, in or near several cities or villages. Those claims could not be independently verified. In what both sides described as a new phase of the war, the Russian assault began Monday along a front stretching more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) from northeastern Ukraine to the country’s southeast. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces tried to ""break through our defenses along nearly the entire front line.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian military was throwing everything it has into the battle, with most of its combat-ready forces now concentrated in Ukraine and just across the border in Russia. “They have driven almost everyone and everything that is capable of fighting us against Ukraine,” he said in his nightly video address to the nation. Despite Russian claims of hitting only military sites, they continue to target residential areas and kill civilians, he said. “The Russian army in this war is writing itself into world history forever as the most barbaric and inhuman army in the world,” Zelenskyy said. Weeks ago, after the abortive Russian push to take Kyiv, the Kremlin declared that its main goal was the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years. A Russian victory in the Donbas would deprive Ukraine of the industrial assets concentrated there, including mines, metals plants and heavy-equipment factories. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon’s assessments of the war, said the Russians had added two more combat units, known as battalion tactical groups, in Ukraine over the preceding 24 hours. That brought the total number of units in the country to 78, all of them in the south and the east, up from 65 last week, the official said. That would translate to about 55,000 to 62,000 troops, based on what the Pentagon said at the start of the war was the typical unit strength of 700 to 800 soldiers. But accurately determining Russia's fighting capacity at this stage is difficult. A European official, likewise speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russia also has 10,000 to 20,000 foreign fighters in the Donbas. They are a mix of mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner Group and Russian proxy fighters from Syria and Libya, according to the official. While Ukraine portrayed the attacks on Monday as the start of the long-feared offensive in the east, some observers noted that an escalation has been underway there for some time and questioned whether this was truly the start of a new offensive. The U.S. official said the offensive in the Donbas has begun in a limited way, mainly in an area southwest of the city of Donetsk and south of Izyum. Justin Crump, a former British tank commander now with the strategic advisory company Sibylline, said the Ukrainian comments could, in part, be an attempt to persuade allies to send more weapons. “What they’re trying to do by positioning this, I think, is ... focus people’s minds and effort by saying, ‘Look, the conflict has begun in the Donbas,’” Crump said. “That partly puts pressure on NATO and EU suppliers to say, ‘Guys, we’re starting to fight now. We need this now.’” President Joe Biden is expected to announce a new weapons package in the coming days that will include additional artillery and ammunition, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country will send heavy artillery to Ukraine. And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told Zelensky that the Netherlands will send more heavy weapons, including armored vehicles. Western arms have played a key role in enabling the outgunned Ukrainians to hold off the Russians. Associated Press journalists in Kharkiv said at least four people were killed and three wounded in a Russian attack on a residential area of the city. The attack occurred as residents attempted to maintain a sense of normalcy, with municipal workers planting spring flowers in public areas. An explosion also rocked Kramatorsk, killing at least one person and wounding three, according to AP journalists at the scene. In Bashtanka, an unspecified number of people were wounded when Russian forces shelled the hospital, destroying the reception area and the dialysis unit, the head of the regional council, Hanna Zamazeeva, said on Facebook. Bashtanka is about 70 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mykolaiv. Eyewitness accounts and reports from officials have given a broad picture of the extent of the Russian advance. But independent reporting in the parts of the Donbas held by Russian forces and separatists is severely limited, making it difficult to know what is happening in many places on the ground. Military experts said the Russians' goal is to encircle Ukrainian troops from the north, south and east. Key to the campaign is the capture of Mariupol, which would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, seized from Ukraine in 2014. It would also free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas. A few thousand Ukrainian troops, by the Russians’ estimate, remained holed up in a sprawling Mariupol steel plant, representing what was believed to be the last major pocket of resistance in the city. Russia issued a new ultimatum to the Ukrainian defenders to surrender Wednesday after a previous ultimatum was ignored. The Russian Defense Ministry said those who surrender will be allowed to live and given medical treatment. There was no immediate response from the Ukrainian troops, but they have repeatedly vowed not to give up. Instead, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, who was among the troops remaining in Mariupol, said the Russian military dropped heavy bombs on the steel plant and hit an “improvised” hospital. “We are pulling people out from under the rubble,” Sviatoslav Palamar told Radio Liberty. Serhiy Taruta, the former governor of the Donetsk region and a Mariupol native, also reported the bombing of the hospital, where he said 300 people, including wounded troops and civilians with children, were sheltered. The reports could not be independently confirmed. Zelenskyy said the Kremlin has not responded to a proposal to exchange Viktor Medvedchuk, the jailed leader of a pro-Russia party, for the Mariupol defenders. ——— Associated Press journalists Mstyslav Chernov and Felipe Dana in Kharkiv, Ukraine; Danica Kirka in London; and Robert Burns and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report, as did other AP staff members around the world. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"Mariupol city council claimed more than 1,000 civilians are in the plant.  Mariupol tries to hang on as Russian forces ramp up offensive Russia's military issued another warning to Ukrainian forces in a Mariupol steel plant on Wednesday, telling them to lay down their arms and leave, according to Russian state media. Russia claimed a ceasefire would begin at the Azovstal steel plant at 2 p.m. Moscow time to allow Ukrainian fighters to safely leave. Ukrainian forces rejected a similar offer on Tuesday. The Mariupol city council claimed Tuesday that there are at least 1,000 civilians seeking shelter in the plant, mostly women with children and the elderly. Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the number of Ukrainian marines and Azov fighters at site. A Russian official, Dmitry Polyansky, accused Ukrainian troops of using civilians at the plant as human shields. “One month into the siege of Azovstal plant, those same radicals and neo-Nazis suddenly declared that allegedly there had been civilians inside the plant all that time, even though until yesterday, they had never uttered a word about it,"" Polyansky told the U.N. Security Council during a session on Ukraine on Tuesday. In a video posted online, Serhiy Voyna, the commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade and commander for Ukraine's marines in Mariupol, made an appeal to world leaders, asking for an extraction from the plant to the territory of a third-party state. ""This could be the last appeal of our lives. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks,"" Voyna said. Voyna spoke to the Washington Post via satellite phone on Tuesday, and said his forces would not make the same mistake made by others and trust Russian guarantees of safe passage, only to see them open fire. Voyna said more than 500 Mariupol military battalion soldiers are wounded. ""We are only defending one object, the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war. We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of 'extraction' and take us to the territory of a third-party state,"" Voyna said.",3
"An officer responded to a noise complaint at the home prior to the shooting.  Neighbor recalls deadly Airbnb shooting As the investigation to identify suspects entered its fourth day in a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh Airbnb house that left two teenagers dead, police amended the number of gunshot survivors from eight to nine. The Pittsburgh Police Department said in a statement that the new non-fatal gunshot victim was taken to a hospital in a private car and arrived at an emergency room on the morning of the shooting in stable condition. Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said another five people suffered cuts and broken bones fleeing the gunfire, some by jumping from second-story windows. No arrests have been announced in the shooting that occurred early Sunday morning during a party at an Airbnb rental in the East Allegheny neighborhood of North Pittsburgh that police said was attended by more than 200 people. Schubert said Tuesday that about two hours before the shooting erupted, a police officer responded to a noise complaint at the Airbnb house, but left after issuing a verbal warning to keep the noise down. ""There was nothing unusual to indicate that something was wrong,"" Schubert said. ""We have some information that shows that a lot of these people didn’t come until after midnight."" The shooting erupted around 12:40 a.m. Sunday, and investigators collected 90 shell casings from the scene, including 50 from inside the Airbnb home. Schubert said the shooting broke out after an ""altercation"" inside the house, but has declined to elaborate. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office identified the two 17-year-olds killed in the shooting as Mathew Steffy-Ross and Jaiden Brown. Both teens were scheduled to graduate from high school in June, according to friends and loved ones. ""Matthew was a fun, loving kid that cared so much about everybody. Matthew would give you the shirt off your back,"" Steffy-Ross' great-aunt, Bonnie McLain, told ABC affiliate station WTAE in Pittsburgh. She described Steffy-Ross, a senior at Grace Non-Traditional Christian Academy in Pittsburgh, as having ""the biggest smile in the world."" ""He cared about people and he loved people, and he acted upon it,"" McLain said, adding that she last spoke to her nephew on Saturday morning and heard of his death from a neighbor on Sunday. Pittsburgh community activist Lee Davis of the Greater Valley Coalition Against Violence told WTAE that he was a mentor to both Steffy-Ross and Brown. ""I have been to over 100 funerals in the 17 years I have been doing this work, and I thought I was all cried out, but when I seen what happened to Jaiden and Matt, the tears just came all over again,"" Davis said. ""It just hurt my heart."" Davis said he knew Brown, a senior at Woodland Hills High School in Pittsburgh, since he was a child. “His energy was great,"" Davis said of Brown. ""Everybody loved him, and he became very well-liked in the community. To see this happen to him was really heartbreaking ... because he had a very bright future."" Cathy Jo Welsh, a member of the youth anti-violence program Helping Out Our People in Pittsburgh, said Brown's father died from an illness a few years and that Steffy-Brown's mother died recently. ""(Steffy-Brown) was just getting his bearings from losing his own mother and just learning how to live with trauma and grief,"" Welsh told WTAE.",6
"Russian forces are tightening the noose around the defenders holed up in a mammoth steel plant that is the last known Ukrainian stronghold in in the besieged city of Mariupol KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces tightened the noose around the defenders holed up Wednesday in a mammoth steel plant that represented the last known Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, as a fighter apparently on the inside pleaded on a video for help: “We may have only a few days or hours left.” With the holdouts coming under punishing new bombing attacks, another attempt to evacuate civilians trapped in the pulverized port city failed because of continued fighting. Meanwhile, the number of people fleeing the country topped 5 million, the Kremlin said it submitted a draft of its demands for ending the war, and the West raced to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons to counter the Russians' new drive to seize the industrial east. With global tensions running high, Russia reported the first successful test launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, the Sarmat. President Vladimir Putin boasted it can overcome any missile defense system and make those who threaten Russia “think twice,"" and the head of the Russian state aerospace agency called the launch out of northern Russia “a present to NATO.” The Pentagon described the test as “routine” and said it wasn't considered a threat. On the battlefield, Ukraine said Moscow continued to mount assaults across the east, probing for weak points in Ukrainian defensive lines. Russia said it launched hundreds of missile and air attacks on targets that included concentrations of troops and vehicles. The Kremlin's stated goal is the capture of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern region that is home to coal mines, metal plants and heavy-equipment factories. Detaching it would give Putin a badly needed victory two months into the war, after the botched attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv. The Luhansk governor said Russian forces now control 80% of his region, which is one of two that make up the Donbas. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region. Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, after seizing the small city of Kreminna, are now threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna. He urged all residents to evacuate immediately. “The occupiers control only parts of these cities, unable to break through to the centers,” Haidai said on the messaging app Telegram. Analysts say the offensive in the east could devolve into a war of attrition as Russia runs up against Ukraine's most experienced, battle-hardened troops, who have fought pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas for eight years. Russia said it presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands for ending the conflict — days after Putin said the talks were at a “dead end.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “the ball is in their court, we’re waiting for a response.” He gave no details on the draft, and it was not clear when it was sent or if it offered anything new to the Ukrainians, who presented their own demands last month. Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy said he had not seen or heard of the proposal, though one of his top advisers said the Ukrainian side was reviewing it. Moscow has long demanded Ukraine drop any bid to join NATO. Ukraine has said it would agree to that in return for security guarantees from a number of other countries. Other sources of tension include the status of both the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where the separatists have declared independent republics recognized by Russia. In devastated Mariupol, Ukraine said the Russians dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of the sprawling Azvostal steel plant, believed to be the city's last pocket of resistance. A few thousand Ukrainian troops, by the Russians’ estimate, remained in the plant and its labyrinth of tunnels and bunkers spread out across about 11 square kilometers (4 square miles). Zelenskyy said about 1,000 civilians were also trapped there. A Ukrainian posted a video plea on Facebook urging world leaders to help evacuate people from the plant, saying, ""We have more than 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of civilians with us, including women and children.” The officer, who identified himself as Serhiy Volynskyy of the 36th Marine Brigade, said: “This may be our last appeal. We may have only a few days or hours left."" The authenticity of the video could not be independently verified. The Russian side issued a new ultimatum to the defenders to surrender, but the Ukrainians have ignored all previous demands. All told, more than 100,000 people were believed trapped with little if any food, water, medicine or heat in Mariupol, which had a pre-war population of over 400,000. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the latest effort to open a safe corridor for women, children and the elderly to escape failed because the Russians did not observe a cease-fire. Many previous such agreements have fallen apart because of continued fighting. A Zelenskyy adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that he and other Ukrainian negotiators were ready to hold talks without any conditions to save the lives of trapped Mariupol defenders and civilians. There was no immediate response from Russia. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned of horrors yet to be revealed in Mariupol, given the death and destruction left behind in Bucha, near Kyiv, after the Russians retreated. “We can only anticipate that when this tide also recedes from Mariupol, we’re going to see far worse, if that’s possible to imagine,” he said. Mariupol holds strategic and symbolic value for both sides. The scale of suffering there has made it a worldwide focal point of the war. Mariupol’s fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, and free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas. As Russia continued to funnel troops and equipment into the Donbas, Western nations rushed to boost the flow of military supplies to Kyiv for this new phase of the war, which is likely to involve trench warfare, long-range artillery attacks and tank battles across relatively open terrain. U.S. President Joe Biden was set to announce plans Thursday to send more military aid to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Biden will detail his plans to add to the roughly $2.6 billion in military assistance the administration has already approved. Canada and the Netherlands also said they would send more heavy weaponry. Also, a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessment of the war, said the training of Ukrainian personnel on American 155 mm howitzers has begun in a European country outside Ukraine, and the first of 18 promised such weapons began arriving on the continent. Putin, meanwhile, boasted that the Sarmat missile has “no equivalents in the world.” The Sarmat is intended to eventually replace the Soviet-built missile code-named Satan by NATO as a major component of Russia's nuclear arsenal. It will ”make those who, in the heat of frantic, aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country think twice,” the Russian leader said. Looking for a path to peace, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres requested meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy in their capitals to discuss how to stop the fighting.

"The World Health Organization says that the number of reported new COVID-19 cases worldwide decreased by nearly a quarter last week BERLIN -- The World Health Organization says that the number of reported new COVID-19 cases worldwide decreased by nearly a quarter last week, continuing a decline since the end of March. The Geneva-based U.N. health agency said in a weekly report that nearly 5.59 million cases were reported between April 11 and 17, 24% fewer than in the previous week. The number of newly reported deaths dropped 21% to 18,215. WHO said new cases declined in every region, though only by 2% in the Americas. The report was dated late Wednesday and sent to journalists on Thursday. The agency said that “these trends should be interpreted with caution as several countries are progressively changing their COVID-19 testing strategies, resulting in lower overall numbers of tests performed and consequently lower numbers of cases detected.” The countries with the highest reported case numbers last week were South Korea with more than 972,000, France with over 827,000 and Germany with more than 769,000, WHO said. The highest numbers of new deaths were reported by the U.S., with 3,076, Russia with 1,784 and South Korea with 1,671. In all, more than 502 million cases of COVID-19 and nearly 6.2 million deaths related to the coronavirus have been reported so far.",6
"The ""stop list"" released by the Russian Foreign Ministry named 29 Americans.

Addressing the latest Russian sanctions at Thursday's press briefing, State Department spokesperson Ned Price -- who was also targeted -- said it was ""nothing less than an accolade to have earned the ire of a government that lies to its own people, brutalizes its neighbors, and seeks to create a world where freedom and liberty are put on the run -- and if they had their way, extinguished."" ""Similarly, it is a great honor to share that enmity with other truth-tellers,"" Price added, naming his counterparts, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby and White House press secretary Jen Psaki, ""as well as a number of journalists who have done incredible work, sharing the jarring, bloody truth of Russia's actions in Ukraine."" In a release, the Russian Foreign Ministry cited the 29 individuals sanctioned Thursday as people who ""form the Russophobic agenda."" Second gentlemen Doug Emhoff, White House chief of staff Ron Klain, ABC News Anchor George Stephanopoulos, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan were also included on the so-called ""stop list.""

The war in Ukraine could plunge millions into malnutrition if governments, donors and funders do not act now to prevent a shortage of the nutritional staples typically exported out of the region, according to an op-ed published Thursday in Nature. Women and children in low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable, according to the op-ed, which was authored by 10 nutrition and food supply experts from all over the world. The nutritional needs of children are high, relative to their body size, and women's nutritional needs are especially high when pregnant and breastfeeding. ""Impacts of malnutrition might be less immediately visible than those of hunger. But left untreated, they can be multi-generational and irreversible,"" the authors wrote. The biggest concern is the long-term implications malnutrition will have on children, Saskia Osendarp, executive director of the Micronutrient Forum and co-coordinator of Standing Together for Nutrition, a consortium of nutrition, economics, food and health system experts, told ABC News. This could include cognitive development, school performance, and, later in life, social capital and the increased risk of chronic diseases, she said. Nutrient deficiencies, particularly in the first 1,000 days in a child's life -- beginning from conception and lasting until the child's second birthday -- can have ""irreversible, lifelong consequences,"" Osendarp said. Existing gender inequality and power imbalances -- which are often exacerbated during crises -- result in women having less agency to direct resources toward feeding themselves and their children, the experts said. Increased prices, the reduced availability of food or difficulties accessing it will directly affect the quality of people's diets, and increased prices and trade problems will reduce the reach of humanitarian services that prevent and treat acute malnutrition, the experts said. When food prices increase, households switch to cheaper staple foods and processed foods instead of buying more nutritious -- and generally more expensive-- foods, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy meat, decreasing the quality of their diets, Osendarp, one of the authors of the op-ed, said. ""So they may be able to cope and to to keep their caloric intakes at a level to some point, but then they will suffer from nutrient deficiencies,"" she said. In addition, budgets currently devoted to improving people's nutritional status could be redirected to other, more urgent needs as a result of the war, according to the op-ed. The World Food Programme estimated that in 2022, 323 million people would be in urgent need of assistance when it comes to obtaining sufficient food and nutrients. Ukraine is considered on one of the breadbaskets of the world and is a top 10 global exporter of a number of key agricultural products, including wheat, barley, corn, sunflower oil, soybeans and poultry. An estimated 70% of the country is used for farmland -- land that is currently being devastated by assaults by Russian forces. Countries in Africa and the Middle East are particularly vulnerable, while Somalia and Benin have a total dependence on imports of mostly Russian and Ukrainian wheat, according to a rapid assessment by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Several countries rely on Russia and Ukraine for more than half their wheat imports. The number of malnourished people, especially women and children, is expected to increase as a result of record-high price hikes and disruptions in the trade of food, fertilizer and fuel, according to the paper. Cities such as Odessa and Mariupol, where about 70% of Ukraine's exports are moved from, have now been blocked due to incessant Russian shelling, according to USAID. This is not an isolated crisis, Osendarp said. Two years into the pandemic, governments are still recovering from the global economic stressors of the virus as well as climate change-related events, such as severe droughts in the Horn of Africa, as well as increased conflict in other war-torn regions, such as Ethiopia and in Yemen, she said. The authors called for the cessation of trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition and for the use of social protection measures, such as food or cash transfers, specifically tailored to address malnutrition. Protection of financial commitments already made for nutrition, both within nations and globally, and increased investment in humanitarian resources beyond the promises already made will also be necessary, they said. Without an immediate humanitarian response, it is almost guaranteed that the numbers of malnourished children and mothers will increase and will affect generations to come, Osendarp said. ""It will affect millions and millions of mothers and children, and we can just simply not afford to lose that generation,"" she said.

"New satellite images show what appear to be mass graves near Mariupol KYIV, Ukraine -- Satellite images released Thursday showed what appeared to be mass graves near Mariupol, and local officials accused Russia of burying up to 9,000 Ukrainian civilians there in an effort to conceal the slaughter taking place in the siege of the port city. The images emerged hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in the battle for the Mariupol, despite the presence of an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters who were still holed up at a giant steel mill. Putin ordered his troops not to storm the stronghold but to seal it off “so that not even a fly comes through.” Satellite image provider Maxar Technologies released the photos, which it said showed more than 200 mass graves in a town where Ukrainian officials say the Russians have been burying Mariupol residents killed in the fighting. The imagery showed long rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside Mariupol. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of “hiding their military crimes” by taking the bodies of civilians from the city and burying them in Manhush. The graves could hold as many as 9,000 dead, the Mariupol City Council said Thursday in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Boychenko labeled Russian actions in the city as “the new Babi Yar,” a reference to the site of multiple Nazi massacres in which nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews were killed in 1941. “The bodies of the dead were being brought by the truckload and actually simply being dumped in mounds,” an aide to Boychenko, Piotr Andryushchenko, said on Telegram. There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin. When mass graves and hundreds of dead civilians were discovered in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv after Russian troops retreated three weeks ago, Russian officials denied that their soldiers killed any civilians there and accused Ukraine of staging the atrocities. In a statement, Maxar said a review of previous images indicates that the graves in Manhush were dug in late March and expanded in recent weeks. After nearly two lethal months of bombardment that largely reduced Mariupol to a smoking ruin, Russian forces appear to control the rest of the strategic southern city, including its vital but now badly damaged port. But a few thousand Ukrainian troops, by Moscow's estimate, have stubbornly held out for weeks at the steel plant, despite a pummeling from Russian forces and repeated demands for their surrender. About 1,000 civilians were also trapped there, according to Ukrainian officials. Instead of sending troops to finish off the defenders in a potentially bloody frontal assault, Russia apparently intends to maintain the siege and wait for the fighters to surrender when they run out of food or ammunition. Boychenko rejected any notion that Mariupol had fallen into Russian hands. “The city was, is and remains Ukrainian,” he declared. “Today our brave warriors, our heroes, are defending our city.” The capture of Mariupol would represent the Kremlin’s biggest victory yet of the war in Ukraine. It would help Moscow secure more of the coastline, complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014, and free up more forces to join the larger and potentially more consequential battle now underway for Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, the Donbas. Putin expressed concern for the lives of Russian troops in deciding against sending them in to clear out the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, where the die-hard defenders were hiding in a maze of underground passageways. At a joint appearance with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin declared, “The completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success,” and he offered congratulations to Shoigu. Shoigu predicted the steel plant could be taken in three to four days, but Putin said that would be “pointless."" “There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities,” the Russian leader said. “Block off this industrial area so that not even a fly comes through.” The plant covers 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is threaded with some 24 kilometers (15 miles) of tunnels and bunkers. “The Russian agenda now is not to capture these really difficult places where the Ukrainians can hold out in the urban centers, but to try and capture territory and also to encircle the Ukrainian forces and declare a huge victory,” retired British Rear Adm. Chris Parry said. Russian officials for weeks have said capturing the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas is the war’s main objective. Moscow’s forces opened the new phase of the fighting this week along a 300-mile (480-kilometer) front from the northeastern city of Kharkiv to the Azov Sea. While Russia continued heavy air and artillery attacks in those areas, it did not appear to gain any significant ground over the past few days, according to military analysts, who said Moscow's forces were still ramping up the offensive. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon’s assessment, said the Ukrainians were hindering the Russian effort to push south from Izyum. Rockets struck a neighborhood of Kharkiv on Thursday, and at least two civilians were burned to death in their car. A school and a residential building were also hit, and firefighters tried to put out a blaze and search for anyone trapped. Elsewhere, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian troops kidnapped a local official heading up a humanitarian convoy in the southern Kherson region. She said the Russians offered to free him in exchange for Russian prisoners of war, but she characterized that as unacceptable. Vereshchuk also said efforts to establish three humanitarian corridors in the Kherson region failed Thursday because Russian troops did not hold their fire. Western nations, meanwhile, rushed to pour heavy weapons into Ukraine to help it counter the offensive in the east. U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance, including heavy artillery, 144,000 rounds of ammunition and drones. But he also warned that the $13.6 billion approved last month by Congress for military and humanitarian aid is “almost exhausted” and more will be needed. All told, more than 100,000 people were believed trapped with little or no food, water, heat or medicine in Mariupol, which had a prewar population of about 430,000. Over 20,000 people have been killed in the siege, according to Ukrainian authorities. The city has seized worldwide attention as the scene of some of the worst suffering of the war, including deadly airstrikes on a maternity hospital and a theater. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of launching attacks to block civilian evacuations from the city. On Thursday, at least two Russian attacks hit the city of Zaporizhzhia, a way station for people fleeing Mariupol. No one was wounded, the regional governor said. Among those who arrived in Zaporizhzhia after fleeing Mariupol were Yuriy and Polina Lulac, who spent nearly two months living in a basement with at least a dozen other people. There was no running water and little food, Yuriy Lulac said. “What was happening there was so horrible that you can’t describe it,” said the native Russian speaker who used a derogatory word for the Russian troops, saying they were “killing people for nothing.” “Mariupol is gone. In the courtyards there are just graves and crosses,” Lulac said. The Red Cross said it expected to to evacuate 1,500 people by bus, but that the Russians allowed only a few dozen to leave and pulled some people off of the buses. Dmitriy Antipenko said he lived mostly in a basement with his wife and father-in-law amid death and destruction. “In the courtyard, there was a little cemetery, and we buried seven people there,” Antipenko said, wiping away tears. ——— Associated Press journalists Mstyslav Chernov and Felipe Dana in Kharkiv, Ukraine; Yesica Fisch in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine; Danica Kirka in London; and Robert Burns and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report, as did other AP staff members around the world. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"The United Nations’ human rights office has pointed to what it says is growing evidence of war crimes since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, declaring that humanitarian law appears to have been “tossed aside.” On Location: April 22, 2022 BERLIN -- The United Nations' human rights office on Friday pointed to what it said is growing evidence of war crimes since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, declaring that humanitarian law appears to have been “tossed aside.” Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said that “our work to date has detailed a horror story of violations perpetrated against civilians.” Her office's mission in Ukraine so far has verified 5,264 civilian casualties, including 2,345 deaths, since the war began on Feb. 24. It said that 92.3% of those were recorded in Ukrainian government-controlled territory. The office uses strict methodology and has long acknowledged that its confirmed figures are far short of the real numbers. “The actual numbers are going to be much higher"" as more details emerge from places such as Mariupol where there is intense fighting, Bachelet said. “Over these eight weeks, international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside,” she added. Her office said in a statement that “Russian armed forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure — actions that may amount to war crimes.” It added that the U.N. mission also has “documented what appears to be the use of weapons with indiscriminate effects, causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects, by Ukrainian armed forces in the east of the country.” Bachelet said that “the scale of summary executions of civilians in areas previously occupied by Russian forces” is emerging. On April 9, U.N. human rights officers visiting Bucha documented the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians, her office said. The U.N. mission has received more than 300 allegations of killings of civilians in previously occupied towns in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions. Russian officials have denied that their soldiers killed any civilians in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv from which they retreated three weeks ago, and accused Ukraine of staging the atrocities. The U.N. rights office said its mission also has recorded 114 attacks on medical facilities “although the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher.” “We estimate that at least 3,000 civilians have died because they couldn’t get medical care and because of the stress on their health amid the hostilities,"" Bachelet said. ""This includes being forced by Russian armed forces to stay in basements or not being allowed to leave their homes for days or weeks.” The U.N. mission so far has received 75 allegations of sexual violence against women, men, girls and boys by Russian soldiers, most in the Kyiv region. The human rights office said detention of civilians “has become a widespread practice” in areas controlled by Russian forces and affiliated groups, with 155 such cases reported so far. It said it also received information about “alleged arbitrary and incommunicado detentions” by Ukrainian forces or people aligned with them. And it pointed to videos put out by both sides apparently showing the intimidation, interrogation, torture or killing of prisoners of war. ——— Follow all AP stories on Russia’s war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"Russia hopes to surround and destroy Ukrainian forces in Donbas, officials say.  ABC News Live: President Biden announces $800M in new military aid to Ukraine As Russia's military gears up for what it hopes will be a decisive victory over Ukraine in the eastern part of the country, the U.S. is rushing to send weapons and equipment needed to hold off the larger invading force in the rural and open Donbas terrain -- a far different battlefield from the urban fighting where Ukrainian forces held an advantage. What could make all the difference now is the new $800 million military aid package for Ukraine President Joe Biden announced Thursday. It's a race against time -- maybe a matter of weeks, a U.S. defense official said. ""Now they've launched and refocused their campaign to seize new territory in eastern Ukraine, and we're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,"" Biden said of the Russian offensive, which U.S. military officials believe is just getting started. ""We know that time is not our friend,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. Russia gains by being closer to its border With Ukrainian forces focused in the east, Russia intends to push down from the north, near the city of Izium, and up from the south, surrounding the Ukrainian defenders to ""finish them or force them to surrender,"" a senior U.S. official said Thursday. If Russia takes the beleaguered city of Mariupol in the south, it could free up thousands of troops to join the push north to trap Ukraine forces, according to the official. Although Russia and Ukraine have been battling over Donbas for eight years, Russia's concentrated flow of troops and weapons into the region could bring ""a whole different level of fighting,"" Kirby said Tuesday. There are now 85 battalion tactical groups (BTGs), Russia's main fighting units, inside Ukraine, according to the official. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 troops. About 10 of them crossed into the country this week, most heading to the Donbas region. Kirby said the U.S. is focused on sending Ukraine weapons and systems that are not only useful for the rural eastern terrain, but that the Ukrainians can use in the fight without much training. Russia, meanwhile, is trying not to repeat blunders it committed in northern Ukraine, and will enjoy certain geographic advantages in Donbas. Early on, Russian invaders in the north were beset by supply problems, running out of food for troops and fuel for vehicles, failing to achieve any major victories. Pentagon officials believe they did not expect such strong resistance from Ukrainians so didn't adequately prepare for a prolonged fight. But since withdrawing its troops in the north to focus on Donbas, Russia has been putting equipment and support forces in place ahead of its combat troops to favorably condition the battlefield. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby told reporters Monday. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" Another advantage for Russia is that its logistics will be simplified by fighting closer to its own border, while Ukraine will now face the challenge of transporting heavy weapons and ammunition coming over its western border all the way across the country, meaning more miles for something to go wrong, and more chances for Russia to strike these vital shipments. How US-provided artillery and radars could make a difference To stand a chance fighting in the open Donbas landscape, Ukraine will need more long-range weapons and the ability to quickly move troops on the ground and in the air, according to Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and ABC News contributor. The U.S. has sent Ukraine $3.4 billion of aid since the beginning of the invasion, including many thousands of shoulder-fired missiles, small arms and ammunition, body armor, and medical supplies. The two most recent packages, dedicating $800 million of aid each, announced April 13 and 21, were tailored to reflect the new battle space. ""It's different,"" Biden said Thursday. ""It’s flat, it's not in the mountains, and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective."" To that end, the U.S. is sending 90 of its 155mm howitzers, which officials say will begin arriving over the weekend. ""This is going to be the king of battle out there,"" Mulroy said. While Ukraine already has Russian-made artillery pieces, the U.S. and most Western nations do not have the corresponding 152mm ammunition to offer as it runs through its limited stockpiles. The incoming U.S.-made 155mm guns will bring Ukrainian forces extra firepower, but also the ability to be better resupplied by the West. To start, the U.S. is sending 184,000 artillery rounds along with the 90 weapons. Russia has been flowing its own artillery into Donbas in preparation for its renewed offensive. To help Ukraine counter the threat, the U.S. is sending 14 radar systems that can detect incoming artillery and other indirect-fire attacks and find where they're coming from. ""Right now the Russians are kind of just lobbing artillery without any consequence,"" Mulroy said. ""They want to give them a whole lot of consequence."" The radar systems can help the Ukrainians accurately fire back. ""The counter radar is moving to theater this week,"" a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday, adding that the howitzers and radar systems complement each other, but can also be used independently. Training will be critical About 50 Ukrainians are being trained on the U.S. howitzers outside of the country. This first group of trainees is expected to finish around the same time as the first artillery pieces arrive in their country, likely Sunday or Monday, according to a U.S. official. The U.S. is using a ""train-the-trainer"" approach so as not to pull too many high-demand troops away from the front -- the small group of Ukrainians learning to use the new systems will return to their country to train fellow Ukrainian troops there. The U.S. took a similar approach with the small, explosive Switchblade drones, hundreds of which are headed to Ukraine. A small number of Ukrainians were in the U.S. for pre-scheduled military education when Russia invaded their country. The U.S. capitalized on their presence to add a couple days of training on the Switchblades, which are designed to fly directly into targets and explode. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" a U.S. defense official said on April 6. U.S. officials have said other systems being sent to Ukraine will also require a small period of training, likely to also take place outside of the country. Officials have declined to specify where such training could take place, citing operational security concerns. With Russia intent on surrounding and trapping Ukrainian forces, the ability to move troops quickly by ground and air will be essential, according to Mulroy. ""They're going to try to envelope the Ukrainians and cut them off and starve them,"" he said. ""So, the Ukrainians need to have the ability not to let that happen."" Since the beginning of the invasion, the U.S. has given Ukraine 16 Mi-17 transport helicopters, each able to carry a three-person crew and up to 30 passengers. Mulroy said an advantage of the Soviet-designed Mi-17 is that Ukrainian pilots already know how to fly them. The U.S. has also offered Ukraine hundreds of armored personnel carriers that have tracks similar to those of tanks, as well as armored Humvees. Weather will likely play a factor, and muddy conditions during Spring could limit vehicle mobility for both sides. ""Even just this week, the ground as it is makes it harder for them to operate off of paved roads and highways,"" Kirby said. Time is of the essence Mulroy said the U.S. is doing a great job shipping military aid to the region, but believes more can be done to speed things up. ""We just have to take every opportunity to increase production and improve the flow, because it is going to make a difference,"" he said. The U.S. has not sent Ukraine any of its M1 Abrams tanks, officials saying they are too different from Ukraine's T-72s to be useable in the short term. But other nations with the Soviet-era tanks have given theirs. In total, Ukrainian forces have more tanks in their country than Russia's military, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. A less tangible but very real factor in the fighting so far has been troop morale. The Pentagon sees evidence Russian forces are still suffering from low motivation and poor unit cohesion, according to officials. ""Almost half of their enlisted troops are conscripts who don't receive a lot of training and who we have evidence, even recent evidence, that they've been disillusioned by this war,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. Meanwhile Russian officers are frustrated with the performance of other officers and of their own troops, according to the official. Ukrainian troops have not seemed to suffer any significant morale problems, and throughout the war have been described by U.S. officials as brave and wily in defense of their homeland. Biden praised the resolve of Ukrainians in a meeting with top military leaders at the White House Wednesday. ""I knew they were tough and proud, but I tell you what, they're tougher and more proud than I thought,"" Biden said.",6
"It took the Russian military over a week to acknowledge that one serviceman died and two dozen others were missing after one of its flagship cruisers sank in the Black Sea, reportedly the result of a Ukrainian missiles strike It took the Russian military over a week to acknowledge that one serviceman died and two dozen others were missing after one of its flagship cruisers sank in the Black Sea, reportedly the result of a Ukrainian missiles strike. The acknowledgment happened after families started searching desperately for their sons who, they said, served on the ship and did not come home, and relatives are posing sharp questions about Russia's initial statement that the entire crew was evacuated. Russia's Defense Ministry said Friday in a terse announcement that one crew member died and 27 were left missing after a fire damaged the flagship Moskva cruiser last week, while 396 others were evacuated. The ministry did not offer any explanation for its earlier claims that the full crew got off the vessel before it sank. The loss of the Moskva, one of three missile cruisers of its kind in Russia's fleet, was shrouded in mystery from the moment it was first reported early on April 14. Ukraine said it hit the ship with missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry would not acknowledge an attack, saying only that a fire broke out on the vessel after ammunition detonated, causing serious damage. Moscow even insisted that the ship remained afloat and was being towed to a port, only to admit hours later that it sank after all — in a storm. No images of the ship, or of the supposed rescue operation, were made available. Only several days later, the Russian military released a short and mostly silent video showing rows of sailors, supposedly from the Moskva, reporting to their command in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. The footage offered little clarity on how many sailors were actually evacuated to safety. Soon came the questions. An emotional social media post by Dmitry Shkrebets alleging that his son, a conscript who served as a cook on Moskva, was missing, quickly went viral. The military ""said the entire crew was evacuated. It's a lie! A blatant and cynical lie!” Shkrebets, a resident of Crimea, wrote on VK, a popular Russian social media platform, on April 17, three days after the ship went down. “My son, a conscript, as the very commanders of the Moskva cruiser told me, is not listed among the wounded and the dead and is added to the list of those missing ... Guys, missing in the open sea?!” Similar posts quickly followed from other parts of Russia. The Associated Press found social media posts looking for at least 13 other young men who reportedly served on the Moskva whose families could not find them. One woman spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, as she feared for her son's safety. She said her son was a conscript and had been aboard the Moskva for several months before telling her in early February that the ship was about to depart for drills. She lost touch with him for several weeks after that. The news about Russia invading Ukraine worried her, she said, and she started reading the news online and on social media every day. The last time they spoke on the phone was in mid-March. He was on the ship but did not say where it was. She didn't start looking for him until a day after she learned about trouble aboard the Moskva, because official statements from the Defense Ministry said the crew was evacuated. But no one called or messaged her about her son's whereabouts, and she started to get agitated. Calls to various military officials and hotlines got her nowhere at first, but she persisted. A call she made on the way to a grocery store brought bleak news — that her son was listed as missing and that there was little chance he survived in the cold water. “I said ‘But you said you rescued everyone,’ and he said ‘I only have the lists’. I screamed ‘What are you doing?!’"" she told the AP. “I got hysterical, right at the bus stop (where I was standing), I felt like the ground was giving way under my feet. I started shaking.” The Kremlin statements about the ship’s loss and the crew’s fate follow a historical pattern in which Russia has often met bad news with silence, denials or undercounts about casualties. Previous examples include the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the sinking of the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea in 2000 and the 1994-1996 Chechen war. The families' accounts could not be independently verified. But they went largely uncontested by Russian authorities. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment and redirected the question to the Defense Ministry when asked by the AP during one of his daily conference calls with reporters about families challenging the official statements about sailors being evacuated. The Defense Ministry did not comment on the outcry either — until Friday, when it finally revealed that 27 crew members were missing and one was confirmed dead. The ministry still did not acknowledge an attack on the ship, however. Political analyst Abbas Gallyamov says the sinking of the Moskva is a major political blow for President Vladimir Putin, not so much because of the outcry from families, but because it hurts Putin's image of military might. “This trait, might, is under attack now because we're now talking about the devastation of the fleet,” Gallyamov said. But the families' woes underscores ""that one shouldn't trust the Russian authorities.” In the meantime, some families with missing sons plan to continue seeking the truth. “Now we will turn to figuring out for how long one can ‘go missing’ in the open sea,” Shkrebets posted Friday.",6
"Russian authorities have opened a criminal case against a prominent opposition activist and remanded him in pre-trial detention for allegedly spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces Ukrainian fighters resist Russian forces at Mariupol steel plant Russian authorities have opened a criminal case against a prominent opposition activist and remanded him in pre-trial detention Friday for allegedly spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces. A court in Moscow ordered Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. held in detention until June 12. Lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told reporters that the false information case against Kara-Murza cited a March 15 speech to the Arizona House of Representatives, in which he denounced the war in Ukraine, as the basis for the latest charges. The activist rejects the accusations. Russian media reported that similar charges were being drawn up against outspoken tech executive Ilya Krasilshchik, the former publisher of Russia's top independent news site, Meduza. The moves against the two Kremlin critics are part of a widening crackdown against individuals speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine. Russia adopted a law criminalizing spreading false information about its military shortly after its troops rolled into Ukraine in late February. The offense is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Human rights advocates so far have counted 32 cases targeting critics of the invasion. Kara-Murza is a journalist and a former associate of late Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was assassinated in 2015, and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was jailed for years in Russia. Kara-Murza himself was hospitalized with poisoning symptoms twice, in 2015 and 2017. Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers denounced the Russian government's moves against Kara-Murza. “I am deeply disturbed over news reports regarding the arrest and political persecution of Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza,"" Bowers said in a statement. “Don’t forget about these freedom fighters, like Vladimir Kara-Murza. We must remember names!"" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey tweeted: “Kara-Murza’s brave opposition to Putin has inspired us all. Arizona will always stand for freedom. And we will support those like Kara-Murza who take a stand against oppression.” Krasilshchik, the tech executive who left Russia in early March, told Meduza that he had learnt about the case against him from news reports, which by Friday evening remained unconfirmed. Russian media have linked the charges to an Instagram post, featuring what Krasilshchik said was the photo of charred human remains in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. “You can’t recover after seeing the images from Bucha,” the photo caption read. “You feel that the army of this country of ours, it’s capable of anything … and so is the country. That we’re just an order away from mass executions.” Also Friday, veteran Russian human rights activist Lev Ponomaryov said in an online statement that he was “temporarily” leaving the country. Ponomaryov, a former State Duma lawmaker who had helped found Russia’s oldest human rights organization in the 1980s, has been a vocal opponent of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, and initiated multiple public petitions against it. In his statement Friday, he claimed to be “allowing himself to take a vacation” to “look after my health …, but also think through the difficult situation in which we all find ourselves, and plan further (campaigning) activities, which we cannot stop by any means.” “I doubt my time away will be long,” he added. In a separate move Friday, the Russian justice ministry added Kara-Murza and several other prominent Kremlin critics to the registry of “foreign agents.” The designation implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations that can discredit those on the list. The new additions to the registry included Leonid Volkov, top ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and Alexei Venediktov, former editor-in-chief of Russia's oldest critical radio station, Ekho Moskvy. The station was taken off the airwaves shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. ——— Associated Press writer Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report. ——— Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",8

""The UFT demands that the DOE immediately rescind the aforementioned notices and confirm by the close of business April 22, 2022 that the affected UFT bargaining unit members will remain on the payroll on April 25, 2022 and thereafter,"" the letter added. ""Should the DOE fail to comply with this demand and the due process procedures, the UFT is prepared to initiate litigation to challenge the DOE’s improper actions."" The Department of Education defended its actions in a statement. ""Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 -- universal adult vaccination,"" The Education Department said in a statement. ""We immediately moved to put these employees -- fewer than 100 -- on leave without pay."" New York City has engaged in a prolonged legal battle with teachers over its vaccine mandate. The mandate went into effect on Oct. 4, 2021, at the behest of then-Mayor Bill de Blasio. The city required all public school teachers -- in the largest school system in the country -- to receive at least one dose of the vaccine. The city said 95% of staffers had complied with the rule by Oct. 4. But a legal battle raged on in the courts even after the mandate went into effect, with a group of teachers appealing all the way to the Supreme Court. Just this week, the nation's highest court refused to hear the case without explanation. ABC News' Mark Osborne contributed to this report.",7
"Russia and Ukraine are hurtling toward what could be an epic battle for control of the country’s industrial heartland KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia and Ukraine hurtled toward what could be an epic battle for control of the country’s industrial heartland as Ukrainian officials reported that Moscow had shifted a dozen crack military units from the shattered port of Mariupol to eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia reported Friday that one serviceman was killed and 27 others were left missing after the fire on board the warship Moskva, which sank a week ago following what the Ukrainians boasted was a missile attack. The Russian military previously reported everyone aboard had been rescued. Also Friday, new satellite images showed a second possible mass grave site in a town near Mariupol, where Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a steel plant. The Russian Defense Ministry did not acknowledge an attack on the warship. It continued to say a fire broke out after ammunition detonated, without explaining how that happened. The loss of the guided missile cruiser — the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet — was a humiliating setback for Moscow. In Mariupol, reduced largely to smoking rubble by weeks of bombardment, Russian state TV showed the flag of the pro-Moscow Donetsk separatists raised on what it said was the city's highest point, its TV tower. It also showed what it said was the main building at the city's besieged Azovstal steel plant in flames. The Kremlin has thrown over 100,000 troops and mercenaries from Syria and Libya into the fight in Ukraine and is deploying more forces in the country every day, said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council. “We have a difficult situation, but our army is defending our state,” he said. Numerous cities and villages came under bombardment in the Donbas — the industrial region in the east that the Kremlin has declared the new, main theater of war — as well as in the Kharkiv region just to the west, and in the south, authorities said. Russian forces pummeled the 2,000 Ukrainian fighters still holed up inside the sprawling Azovstal plant, the last known pocket of resistance in the strategic southern port city, the mayor’s office reported. “Every day they drop several bombs on Azovstal,” said Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor. “Fighting, shelling, bombing do not stop.” In other developments, a senior Russian military official publicly outlined Russian war aims that appeared to be wider than what the Kremlin has stated in recent weeks. Rustam Minnekayev said Russia’s forces aim to take full control of southern Urkaine, in addition to eastern Ukraine, and that doing so would open the way to the nation of Moldova, where Russia backs the breakaway region of Transnistria. Responding to Minnekayev’s declaration about Russian forces opening a route to Moldova from southern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine was assumed to be just the beginning; further, they want to grab other countries.” Moldovan officials are warily watching Putin’s actions in Ukraine, and Zelenskyy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak added that Russia “was always lying to everyone and that, in fact from the very beginning, it wanted stupidly to steal some of Ukraine’s territory to secure an outlet to Transnistria.” The latest satellite photos from Maxar Technologies revealed what appeared to be a second mass grave site near Mariupol. The site at a cemetery in the town of Vynohradne has several newly dug parallel trenches measuring about 40 meters (131 feet) long, Maxar said in a statement. A day earlier, Maxar released photos of what appeared to be rows upon rows of more than 200 freshly dug mass graves next to a cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside Mariupol. That prompted Ukrainian accusations that the Russians are trying to conceal the slaughter of civilians in the city. “This confirms again that the occupiers arrange the collection, burial and cremation of dead residents in every district of the city,” Andryushchenko said on the Telegram messaging app. The Ukrainians estimated that the graves seen in the photos released Thursday could hold 9,000 bodies. The Kremlin did not respond to the satellite pictures. Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared victory in the battle for Mariupol despite the steel-mill holdouts. He ordered his forces not to storm the plant to finish off the defenders but to seal it off instead in an apparent bid to force them to surrender. Mariupol has taken on outsize importance in the war. Capturing it would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port and complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Putin seized from Ukraine in 2014. It would also allow Putin to throw more of his forces into the potentially climactic battle for the Donbas and its coal mines, factories and other industries, or what the Kremlin has now declared to be its main objective. Danilov reported that some 12 to 14 of Russia’s elite military units have, in fact, left Mariupol and begun moving to the east to take part in the fighting there. “It will now be difficult for our forces, because our guys in Mariupol were taking (those units) on themselves. It is their courage and feat,” he said. Danilov also said Kyiv managed to deliver weapons via helicopter at great risk under cover of night to the Mariupol steelworks, which have been bombarded for weeks. Putin said Russia gave Ukrainian forces inside the plant the option to surrender, with guarantees to keep them alive, and offered “decent treatment and medical care,” according to an account of a phone call with European Council President Charles Michel, provided by the Kremlin. “But the Kyiv regime does not allow them to take this opportunity,” Putin charged. More than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed trapped in Mariupol with little food, water or heat, and over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the nearly two-month siege, according to Ukrainian authorities. Most attempts to evacuate civilians from the city have failed because of what the Ukrainians said was continued Russian shelling. Days into the Russian offensive to take the east, the campaign has yet to become a full-out assault, with military analysts saying Moscow’s forces are still ramping up and have not achieved any major breakthroughs in the Donbas or gained any significant ground. But shelling attacks killed three civilians in a small town and two villages Friday in the Donetsk region, which is part of the Donbas, the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, posted on a messaging app. Kyrylenko said the Russians opened fire on at least 20 of the region's settlements. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said talks between the two countries have “ground to a halt” because Moscow hasn’t received a response from Kyiv to its latest proposals, the details of which have not been released. Putin’s lead negotiator at the talks, Vladimir Medinsky, said he held several lengthy conversations Friday with the head of the Ukrainian delegation. He gave no details. ——— Fisch reported from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.

"Beijing is on alert after 10 middle school students tested positive for COVID-19, in what city officials say was an initial round of testing BEIJING -- Beijing is on alert after 10 middle school students tested positive for COVID-19, in what city officials said was an initial round of testing. City officials suspended classes in the school for a week following the positive test results on Friday. The Chinese capital also reported four other confirmed cases that day that were counted separately. Mainland China reported 24,326 new community-transmitted infections on Saturday, with the vast majority of them asymptomatic cases in Shanghai, where enforcement of a strict “zero-COVID” strategy has drawn global attention. China has doubled down on the approach even in face of the highly transmissible omicron variant. The zero-COVID policy warded off many deaths and widespread outbreaks when faced with less transmissible variants through mass testing and strict lockdowns where people could not leave their homes. But recent developments in Shanghai have led some to question whether the strategy is worth the tradeoffs. Many residents in the city have struggled to get adequate food supplies during a lockdown this month, while some were also unable to get drugs or medical attention. Some elderly people died after an outbreak at an hospital led medical staff to be quarantined. The country is now facing its worst outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan. Local media reported that in Beijing’s Chaoyang district, the government ordered the suspension of in-person after-school activities and classes. The city government is now conducting a round of mass testing to look for more cases. In Shanghai, city officials reported 12 new deaths Saturday, all elderly patients with underlying illnesses.",6
"COVID-19 vaccines still offer strong protection against severe illness and death, but Moderna and Pfizer are testing combination shots as a possible new kind of booster COVID-19 vaccinations are at a critical juncture as companies test whether new approaches like combination shots or nasal drops can keep up with a mutating coronavirus — even though it’s not clear if changes are needed. Already there’s public confusion about who should get a second booster now and who can wait. There's also debate about whether pretty much everyone might need an extra dose in the fall. “I’m very concerned about booster fatigue” causing a loss of confidence in vaccines that still offer very strong protection against COVID-19’s worst outcomes, said Dr. Beth Bell of the University of Washington, an adviser to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite success in preventing serious illness and death, there's growing pressure to develop vaccines better at fending off milder infections, too — as well as options to counter scary variants. “We go through a fire drill it seems like every quarter, every three months or so” when another mutant causes frantic tests to determine if the shots are holding, Pfizer vaccine chief Kathrin Jansen told a recent meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences. Yet seeking improvements for the next round of vaccinations may seem like a luxury for U.S. families anxious to protect their littlest children — kids under 5 who are not yet eligible for a shot. Moderna's Dr. Jacqueline Miller told The Associated Press that its application to give two low-dose shots to the youngest children would be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration “fairly soon.” Pfizer hasn't yet reported data on a third dose of its extra-small shot for tots, after two didn't prove strong enough. COMBINATION SHOTS MAY BE NEXT The original COVID-19 vaccines remain strongly protective against serious illness, hospitalization and death, especially after a booster dose, even against the most contagious variants. Updating the vaccine recipe to match the latest variants is risky, because the next mutant could be completely unrelated. So companies are taking a cue from the flu vaccine, which offers protection against three or four different strains in one shot every year. Moderna and Pfizer are testing 2-in-1 COVID-19 protection that they hope to offer this fall. Each “bivalent” shot would mix the original, proven vaccine with an omicron-targeted version. Moderna has a hint the approach could work. It tested a combo shot that targeted the original version of the virus and an earlier variant named beta — and found vaccine recipients developed modest levels of antibodies capable of fighting not just beta but also newer mutants like omicron. Moderna now is testing its omicron-targeted bivalent candidate. But there's a looming deadline. FDA's Dr. Doran Fink said if any updated shots are to be given in the fall, the agency would have to decide on a recipe change by early summer. DON’T EXPECT BOOSTERS EVERY FEW MONTHS For the average person, two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine plus one booster — a total of three shots — “gets you set up” and ready for what may become an annual booster, said Dr. David Kimberlin, a CDC adviser from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. After that first booster, CDC data suggests an additional dose offers most people an incremental, temporary benefit. Why the emphasis on three shots? Vaccination triggers development of antibodies that can fend off coronavirus infection but naturally wane over time. The next line of defense: Memory cells that jump into action to make new virus-fighters if an infection sneaks in. Rockefeller University researchers found those memory cells become more potent and able to target more diverse versions of the virus after the third shot. Even if someone who's vaccinated gets a mild infection, thanks to those memory cells “there's still plenty of time to protect you against severe illness,” said Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. But some people — those with severely weakened immune systems — need more doses up-front for a better chance at protection. And Americans 50 and older are being offered a second booster, following similar decisions by Israel and other countries that offer the extra shot to give older people a little more protection. The CDC is developing advice to help those eligible decide whether to get an extra shot now or wait. Among those who might want a second booster sooner are the elderly, people with health problems that make them particularly vulnerable, or who are at high risk of exposure from work or travel. COULD NASAL VACCINES BLOCK INFECTION? It’s hard for a shot in the arm to form lots of virus-fighting antibodies inside the nose where the coronavirus latches on. But a nasal vaccine might offer a new strategy to prevent infections that disrupt people’s everyday lives even if they’re mild. “When I think about what would make me get a second booster, I actually would want to prevent infection,” said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, who chairs CDC’s immunization advisory committee. “I think we need to do better.” Nasal vaccines are tricky to develop and it's not clear how quickly any could become available. But several are in clinical trials globally. One in late-stage testing, manufactured by India’s Bharat Biotech, uses a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver a harmless copy of the coronavirus spike protein to the lining of the nose. “I certainly do not want to abandon the success we have had” with COVID-19 shots, said Dr. Michael Diamond of Washington University in St. Louis, who helped create the candidate that’s now licensed to Bharat. But “we’re going to have a difficult time stopping transmission with the current systemic vaccines,"" Diamond added. “We have all learned that.” ——— The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Yevheniia Kravchuk says Ukraine is looking for three main things from the U.S. 'We are capable of winning' and kicking Russians out: Ukrainian Parliament member As the people of Ukraine continue to defend against a Russian onslaught, Yevheniia Kravchuk, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, says the nation is still looking for three main things from the United States: heavy weapons, sanctions on Russia and financial aid. ""We need more weapons... Because right now Russians are putting artillery, tanks, everything they have, and also they bombed civilians to terrorize the whole country,"" Kravchuk told ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz. ""As long as we're getting more than we burn every day, we are capable of winning and we're capable of kicking Russians out because that's the way how to end this -- to end this war."" Last week, President Joe Biden announced another $800 million to aid Ukrainian military efforts in the Donbas region and said he will send a supplemental budget request to Congress to keep supporting the nation. The new aid includes artillery weapons, anti-air missiles and helicopters. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also announced Thursday the department would provide an additional $500 million in financial aid. Kravchuk, a member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party in the nation's parliament, said it's important that the U.S. provide the offensive weapons ""because it's sort of a green light to other countries in Europe, for example, to give these weapons as well."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Russia had taken the eastern city of Mariupol, a claim Ukrainians have pushed back on with 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers holed up in a steel plant as they continue to fight. There have also been reports of 120,000 civilians still trapped in the besieged city. Last week, just four buses and a few private vehicles were able to escape the city -- the first to leave in about two weeks. ""Is there any chance for [a] humanitarian corridor at this point?"" Raddatz asked. ""Yesterday Russians did not let the humanitarian corridor to work,"" Kravchuk said. ""Hundreds of people were gathered at one point to go out of Mariupol and Russian soldiers just came and said no, we're not allowing this to happen."" She said Russian soldiers are making ""forcible deportations"" out of Ukraine to Vladivostok, a Russian city thousands of miles away. ""And we do not know how to bring them back to Ukraine. They have pulled these people from Mariupol -- they are put to filtration camps,"" Kravchuk said. ""It's sort of something that can't be happening in the 21st Century. And we really hope that maybe with help of other Western leaders, other leaders of similar worlds, we will be able to take out the kids and women who are still in the basements of this factory and inside of Mariupol."" Zelenskyy has announced that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will arrive in Kyiv on Sunday to discuss the logistics of providing more military assistance. U.S. officials have yet to confirm the visit. Asked by Raddatz about the significance of that visit, Kravchuk called it ""a really, really symbolical and powerful signal to Russia that Ukraine will not be left alone with this war.""",9
"ABC News contacted officials from health departments in all 50 states. Vaccines explained by Dr. Jen Ashton While top U.S. health officials are urging some Americans to get yet another coronavirus booster shot, local health departments across the country are grappling with a growing dilemma -- how to address a declining demand for vaccines, while minimizing the waste of unused millions of doses currently in state stockpiles and at risk of expiring. Since the emergency use authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. last winter, federal data shows that states received a staggering 720 million doses, and more than 570 million of those shots have been administered. However, an ABC News analysis of state-provided data found that millions of those shots have not ended up in arms, largely due to a significant decline in the number of individuals willing to get vaccinated — with many vaccine doses now left unused in refrigerators or discarded in trash cans across the country. ABC News contacted officials from health departments in all 50 states, and in analyzing state provided data, found that tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have either gone to waste, remain unused, or will expire in the coming weeks and months. ""It is a tremendous loss of opportunity for these vaccines to not make it into the shoulders of those who need them,"" C. Buddy Creech, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program and associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases, told ABC News. ""Not only is it a financial loss for the purchaser of vaccines -- the U.S. government -- but also a significant health loss for those who are not yet protected from COVID and its complications."" How some states are working to ensure shots don't go unused Although the total number of vaccines at risk of being wasted is not publicly accessible in every state, available data provides insight into some states' efforts to ensure the shots do not go unused. ""We have worked with local public health to fill orders for vaccine from providers with existing inventory versus ordering new doses, and to redistribute vaccine with soon to expire dates to use up inventory within the state before we order more with longer expiration dates,"" Lynn Sutfin, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health told ABC News. ""Our field reps are moving vaccines across the state to help redistribute as needed to avoid wastage."" In Michigan, about 1.7 million doses have been wasted since Dec. 2020, and more than 100,000 more doses are set to expire in the next two weeks. Vaccine dose wastage can result from a variety of issues, including dropped vials and syringes; and improperly prepared, unused, or expiring vaccine doses, various officials reported. ""Most of the wasted or unused doses are reported because a provider punctures a multidose vial in order to give someone a vaccine but does not necessarily have enough people to give the remaining doses before the vial expires,"" a representative for the State Joint Information Center in Colorado, where more than 619,000 doses have been unused, told ABC News. ""This is aligned with CDC's best practices that advise providers to not miss any opportunity to vaccinate every eligible person."" In large states like California, where more than 70% of residents are fully vaccinated, nearly 3.6 million shots are sitting in the state's stockpile, according to state data. Similarly, in North Carolina, where 60% of residents have completed their primary vaccination series, 856,000 shots are currently available under state inventory, while 1.7 million shots have been wasted after the doses expired or were improperly opened. Nearly 760,000 vaccine doses have been designated as non-viable, spoiled, or expired, officials in Oregon reported, but officials told ABC News that such totals are ""not unexpected."" ""As demand for vaccines wanes, we expect there to be a similar drop in the number of doses vaccine providers request and, as a result, a decrease in the number of unused doses. Oregon will be left with excess inventory, but we believe that we have done everything we can to minimize waste,"" a representative for the Oregon Health Authority told ABC News. Many states ordered hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses in bulk in order to ensure they had enough shots to meet demand, but in many cases, the need turned out to not be as high as initially expected. Although the total number of shots wasted in states was high, many state organizers stressed that the overall percentage of wasted doses was relatively low, in comparison to the number of shots provided to residents. Officials said they continue to work to minimize wastage by controlling the amount of vaccine that is ordered and shipped to the state, and by redistributing vaccine when possible within the state. 55 million eligible Americans still without a shot Last spring, millions of Americans flocked to COVID-19 vaccination clinics across the country to get their shots. In April of 2021, when every adult became eligible to get vaccinated, more than two million people were getting their first doses every day. Overall, more than 220 million Americans have received a shot, representing about two-thirds of the U.S. population. Earlier this month, a new study from The Commonwealth Fund found that the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine program is now estimated to have prevented 2.2 million deaths, 17 million hospitalizations and 66.1 million additional infections through March 2022. Now, a little less than a year later, with those most eager to get the shots now inoculated, vaccination rates have plummeted, federal data shows. A sizable group of more than 55 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated against the virus. ""The pool of people that are unvaccinated is likely to remain unconvinced of the importance of vaccine-induced protection,"" Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said, adding that convincing those still hesitant to get the shot will be a difficult feat. In recent weeks, following the introduction of a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose for some older and high-risk populations, there has been a slight uptick in the overall number of doses administered. However, the number of Americans initiating vaccination remains at a near record low of just over 50,000 Americans getting their first dose every day. ""Efforts including incentives, improved convenience, mandates and targeted public health messaging during a surge have all had various successes in increasing vaccination rates. It's hard to imagine what might influence someone to change their stance especially with cases at low levels and restrictions being lifted,"" Brownstein said. Dr. Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, described the waste of millions of COVID-19 doses in the U.S. as a ""tragic combination of events."" ""The vaccine development was both one of the miraculous triumphs and one of the tragedies of the COVID response,"" Morse told ABC News, further referencing a combination of factors to blame, including vaccine nationalism, in which wealthy countries, such as the U.S., pre-ordered large quantities of the shots, making less vaccine available for the rest of the world, and persistent issues with vaccine hesitancy. ""We naïvely underestimated the extent of vaccine hesitancy and resistance, some driven by what WHO called the 'infodemic' of misinformation and disinformation, which persists to this day,"" Morse said. Vaccine access and wastage a stark reminder of privilege Some politicians and public health experts have raised concerns over the ethical implications of so many shots going to waste. ""The wastage of millions of doses is a stark reminder of the privilege we have had in accessing vaccines while the majority of the world had to wait months. Extraordinary resources and financial investment will ultimately go to waste,"" Brownstein said. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons warned last week that millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses, which were set to be shipped overseas, could expire, without proper funding from Congress. ""I was so disappointed that we, in Congress, could not come together and deliver critically needed global help to deliver the vaccines that we've already invented, developed and purchased, and to make sure that the nearly 3 billion people around the world who haven't yet had a single vaccine dose get some protection against this pandemic,"" Coons told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""We'll negotiate what we have to in order to secure a chance to move forward and not waste the vital vaccines America has already purchased,"" Coons added. There may be additional ethical concerns about not donating enough shots to ensure that people can receive a full vaccination series. ""There are significant operational and potentially ethical issues around donating vaccines to other countries; is it ethical to donate the first dose when there is no guarantee of a second? What if the vaccine has not yet been approved in that country? Given how rigorously we regulate and authorize vaccines around the world, it is likely no surprise that the process of donating vaccines can become complicated very quickly,"" Creech added. Even if states wanted to donate their stockpiles to other countries in need, with so many doses left unused in the U.S., Brownstein explained that logistically, such donations would be near impossible. ""Once a vaccine ends up at a site, it is administered or thrown out. There is usually no third option of sending it to another site and even lower chance it could go to another state let alone another country,"" Brownstein said. ""These expired doses are a reminder of our challenged logistical platforms. While we optimized for distribution to vaccination sites, there was very little capacity to shift supply especially across jurisdictions."" A continued concern for many health experts is vaccinating the rest of the globe, as they say the pandemic will never truly subside until vaccine-use is widespread and equitable. ""Assuming we won't get immediate supply for most of the world, the best solution might be to retest and determine if we can legitimately extend shelf life,"" Morse said, adding that he does not believe donating short-dated doses is realistic. ""We certainly should intensify efforts to provide vaccine now to those who, for some reason, haven't yet been vaccinated and may now be willing to take it if vaccine is easily available,"" Morse said. ""Unfortunately, in the U.S., I fear we've reached diminishing returns by now. It would have been far better if everyone had gotten two doses early on, which might have slowed the virus down.""",7
"The trip was shrouded in secrecy -- until Ukraine's Zelenskyy announced it. Zelenskyy meets with US officials about war in Ukraine In the quiet weekend morning hours Saturday, two of President Joe Biden's top advisers boarded their flights -- the start of a long journey shrouded in secrecy. It was a secret -- until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spilled just hours after they were wheels up. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin were coming to visit Kyiv, the war-time president announced. While the Biden administration refused to comment all weekend, it was a hiccup that could have derailed the secret visit, amid intense security concerns about sending two Cabinet officials to an active war zone. In the end, Blinken, Austin, and a small delegation arrived in Kyiv Sunday for a three-hour meeting with Zelenskyy, carrying with them a number of major announcements to make -- millions more in U.S. security assistance, increased U.S. training for Ukrainian troops, the return of U.S. diplomats to Ukraine, and after three years of vacancy, a nominee for a new U.S. ambassador. Senior State and Defense Department officials dismissed any concerns that Zelenskyy's announcement imperiled the trip: ""We plan for any number of contingencies. ... It didn't change anything about our commitment to go there today and to share what we have to say,"" a senior State Department official told reporters Sunday. But the administration refused to confirm the trip took place until the early morning hours Monday -- only when the U.S. team returned across the border in Poland. ""We don't know how the rest of this war will unfold, but we do know that a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene, and our support for Ukraine going forward will continue,"" Blinken told reporters Monday morning in Poland. The visit was the first by senior U.S. officials since Russia's invasion started 60 days ago -- ""part symbolism but also very substantive,"" Blinken said as he sat across the table from Zelenskyy. That substance was in what he and Austin carried with them, including $165 million for Ukraine to purchase ammunition for its Soviet-era weaponry and $322 million for Ukraine to purchase from defense firms -- what's known as foreign military financing. In total, the Biden administration intends to obligate more than $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 other European countries, virtually all of whom have supported Ukraine's military from their own stockpiles. Blinken also announced Biden would formally nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat currently serving as U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, to serve as envoy in Kyiv. U.S. diplomats will eventually return to the capital too, Blinken said, as they start this week by making the journey across the border from Poland to Lviv on a daily basis. It's a journey Blinken and Austin now know personally. They arrived in southeastern Poland Saturday evening near the border with Ukraine -- riding the train to Kyiv in the opposite direction from the nearly three million Ukrainian refugees who've arrived in Poland. As passengers, they saw little of the war-torn country, according to a senior State Department official, who said shades on the windows blacked out much of the view. Once in the capital, no longer under Russian siege, Blinken said there were signs that normal life was returning. ""We certainly saw people on the streets in Kyiv -- evidence of that fact that the battle for Kyiv was won, and there is what looks from the surface at least to be normal life,"" he told reporters afterwards. ""But that's in stark contrast to what's going on in other parts of Ukraine -- in the south and the east -- where the Russian brutality is doing horrific things to people every single day."" From the train, they traveled straight to the presidential palace for three hours of meetings with Zelenskyy and his team, according to a senior State Department official, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, and Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President. ""We had a really good, detailed, substantive, focused conversation for the better part of three hours that really went into every aspect of this campaign and next steps,"" the senior State Department official said. It was the first time senior U.S. officials had seen Zelenskyy since Russia invaded -- a chance to check in on the TV star, who won a surprising presidential election, and who's become a wartime leader and world figure. When a U.S. delegation visited Zelenskyy last May -- the first meeting between Biden officials and a Ukrainian president already bruised by American politics -- Zelenskyy was ""constantly energized, moving from one thing to another,"" the senior State Department official said. ""Now, there's a deliberateness and a kind of gravitas,"" they said, describing him as ""very focused, very detail-oriented on different aspects of this, whether the security, the economic, the humanitarian, the sanctions. He went into real detail on each, but in a very deliberate way."" Even physically, he ""looked remarkably well,"" the official added. When the U.S. delegation asked about his family, Zelenskyy said they were doing ok, but ""'the hard part is we just don't see each other. We miss each other,'"" the official recounted him saying. ""It was just a kind of human moment. Everyone in this thing is an individual with their own individual lives and family lives,"" they added. ""He's going from being a TV celebrity to maybe the most recognized leader -- other than the president of the United States and Vladimir Putin -- in the world. He's borne that remarkably well."" An in-person conversation makes working through any differences easier, officials said -- including Zelenskyy's push for the U.S. to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The designation, made by the State Department, carries the strictest U.S. sanctions, although Russia is already under many of them. Zelenskyy personally asked Biden to designate Russia during a phone call earlier this month, a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News. The designation is for governments that support terrorist groups, not ones that terrorize, per the senior State Department official, who said during their talks, they explained State Department lawyers are reviewing the possibility, ""but it's a statute. It's a legal determination."" ""Look, the Russians are terrorizing the Ukrainians. But that's different than saying they meet the criteria of the SST [state sponsor of terrorism designation]."" But if face-to-face interactions are that important, it begs the question why didn't Biden himself go. Another senior State Department official pointed to security concerns. ""The president of the United States is somewhat singular in terms of what travel would require, so it goes well beyond what a cabinet secretary would - or what virtually any other world leader - would require.""",3
"COVID-19 hospital admissions among children are also on the rise. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations increasing across the United States  For the second consecutive week, new COVID-19 infection rates among children in the U.S. have seen a notable increase, according to a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Children’s Hospital Association (CHA). Last week, 37,000 additional child COVID-19 cases were reported, an increase of about 43% from two weeks ago. The jump in infections follows weeks of steady declines, and marks the first increase since January. Overall, numbers remain significantly lower than during other surges of the pandemic. However, many Americans, who are taking at-home tests, are not submitting their results to their local public health authorities. Thus, health experts said that daily case totals are likely significantly higher than the numbers officially reported and tallied. In the Northeast, infection rates are at their highest level in eight weeks, while the Midwest is reporting its highest proportion of new cases since the end of February. A total of 12.9 million children have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic, and children represent about a fifth of all reported cases on record. Nationally, pediatric virus-related hospital admissions have also seen their first increase in three months — up by 5% in the last week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, AAP and CHA report that a small percentage of pediatric cases have resulted in hospitalization and death. According to the nearly two dozen states, which reported pediatric hospitalizations, 0.1%-1.5% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization. ?Similarly, in states which reported virus-related deaths by age, 0.00%-0.27% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death. Even so, health experts stress that any uptick in severe illness among children is concerning. The increases in pediatric COVID cases are renewing calls for children to be inoculated against COVID-19. Although the COVID-19 has been authorized under emergency use for all children over the age of 5 for nearly six months, tens of millions of children remain completely unvaccinated. At this time, just under 26 million children, over the age of 5 — about half of those eligible — remain completely unvaccinated, and overall, just 43.1% of eligible children have been fully vaccinated. Many parents of young children have also been vocalizing their frustration over the delayed rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine for children under the age of five. Top Biden administration officials said those shots could be available as early as June. Both Moderna or Pfizer have yet to fully submit their vaccine data to the Food and Drug Administration, the agency said last week, but Moderna, which has a two-dose vaccine for children under five, is expected to officially file a request for authorization by the end of the month, a spokesperson for the company confirmed. Pfizer, which has been conducting clinical trials on a three-dose vaccine for kids under five, is expected to have results by early May, is projecting an authorization of its three-dose vaccine sometime in June, according to the company’s CEO, Albert Bourla. “I am frustrated on their behalf,” White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" said, in reference to some of his friends, who are frustrated that vaccines for young children have yet to be authorized. It’s “very hard to prejudge a specific date and time” as to when these vaccines will become available, Jha said, adding that he expects the shots to be available in the “next couple months.” AAP and CHA noted there is an ""urgent"" need to collect more age-specific data to assess the severity of illness related to new variants as well as potential longer-term effects. ""It is important to recognize there are immediate effects of the pandemic on children’s health, but importantly we need to identify and address the long-lasting impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth,"" the organizations wrote.",6
"Russia has pounded eastern Ukraine as the U.S. defense secretary promised to “keep moving heaven and earth” to get Kyiv the weapons it needs to repel the new offensive On Location: April 25, 2022 TORETSK, Ukraine -- Russia pounded eastern Ukraine on Tuesday as the U.S. defense secretary promised to “keep moving heaven and earth” to get Kyiv the weapons it needs to repel the new offensive even as Moscow warned such support risked widening the war. Two months into the devastating conflict, Western arms have already helped Ukraine stall Russia’s invasion — but its leaders have said they need more support fast. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that more help was on the way, as he convened a meeting of officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany to pledge more weapons. Germany announced it cleared the way for delivery of Gepard anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine. “This gathering reflects the galvanized world,” Austin said in his opening remarks. He added that he wanted officials to leave the meeting “with a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them.” After fierce defense by Ukrainian forces thwarted Russia's attempt to take Ukraine's capital early in the war, Moscow now says its focus is the Donbas. In the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine, separatists backed by Russia have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014. The current war has spread devastation around Ukraine, leaving thousands of civilians dead and pushing millions to flee the country. It has raised food prices and energy costs worldwide and upended the post-Cold War security balance in Europe. In the small city of Toretsk in the Donbas, residents are struggling to survive, collecting rainwater for cleaning and washing up and fervently hoping for an end to the fighting. “It’s bad. Very bad. Hopeless,” said Andriy Cheromushkin. “You feel so helpless that you don’t know what you should do or shouldn’t do. Because if you want to do something, you need some money; and there is no money now.” In its latest assessment of the fighting, the British Defense Ministry described Russian advances and heavy fighting in the east, with one town, Kreminna, reportedly falling after days of street-to-street fighting. Local officials said at least nine people killed and several more wounded by Russian attacks on towns and cities in eastern and southern Ukraine. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces “continue to deliberately fire at civilians and to destroy critical infrastructure.” Ukraine’s General Staff also said Russian forces shelled Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city that lies outside the Donbas but has seen significant attacks as Moscow seeks full control of the region. Ukrainian forces struck back in the Kherson region in the south. With the potentially pivotal battle for the east underway, the U.S. and its NATO allies are scrambling to get artillery and other heavy weaponry to that area in time to make a difference. Russia's progress in the region has been slow so far, as exemplified by the fight for Mariupol, where some Ukrainian forces remain holed up despite a siege since early in the war. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said her government decided on Monday to clear the delivery of Gepard self-propelled armored anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, though she didn’t give details. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced mounting pressure, including from within his governing coalition, to approve sending heavy weapons such as tanks and other armored vehicles to Ukraine. Austin, the American defense secretary, noted Tuesday that more than 30 allies and partners have joined the U.S. in sending security assistance to Ukraine and more than $5 billion worth of equipment has been committed. The meeting in Germany comes after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned weapons supplied by Western countries “will be a legitimate target,” and accused NATO of “pouring oil on the fire” with its support for Ukraine, according to a transcript of his televised remarks on the Foreign Ministry’s website. Lavrov also warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited NATO’s expansion and the risk that Kyiv could join the alliance as reasons for his invasion. U.K. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey rejected Lavrov’s accusations of NATO aggression as “utter nonsense,” and Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the Russian minister's reference to nuclear conflict was not constructive. “A nuclear war cannot be won and it shouldn’t be fought,” Kirby told CNN during an interview from Germany, where he was traveling with Austin. “That kind of rhetoric is clearly not called for in the current scenario. What is called for is Mr. Putin ending this war.” Amid the talk of arms shipments, diplomatic efforts to seek an end to the fighting also continued. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres met Lavrov on Tuesday and called again for a cease-fire. The U.N. chief is scheduled to meet Putin later. Russia’s invasion has worried several countries in eastern Europe that fear they could be next. Those concerns grew in Moldova after a Russian commander said that securing southern Ukraine would open the way to the Moldovan separatist region of Trans-Dniester. On Tuesday, police said explosions knocked down two powerful radio antennas at a facility close to the Ukrainian border, the second explosions reported in the region in as many days. Washington has warned previously that Russian forces could launch “false-flag” operations to create a pretext for invading the territory of other nations. Russian officials have rejected such charges. Elsewhere, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi visited the Chernobyl nuclear plant to deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems after tanks and troops churned up highly contaminated soil there in the early hours of Russia's invasion in February. His visit comes on the anniversary of the disaster at the plant in 1986, the world’s worst nuclear accident. In the largest ground conflict since World War II, Britain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began — far above the 1,351 deaths acknowledged by Moscow. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective.” Ukrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April. The West hopes that boosting arms supplies will help remaining fighters repel Russia's invasion. As he opened the meeting in Germany, Austin sought to reassure Kyiv: “We know, and you should know, that all of us have your back and that’s why we’re here today — to strengthen the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy.” ——— Gambrell reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

"Police in the Moldovan separatist region of Trans-Dniester say two explosions close to the Ukrainian border knocked out a pair of powerful antennas used for broadcasting Russian radio shows On Location: April 26, 2022 BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two explosions in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked a pair of powerful broadcast antennas out of service in Moldova's separatist region of Trans-Dniester, local police said Tuesday. Trans-Dniester, a strip of land with about 470,000 people, has been under the control of separatist authorities since a 1992 war with Moldova. Russia bases about 1,500 troops in the breakaway region, nominally as peacekeepers. Ukrainian officials have expressed concern about Moscow using those forces to invade Ukraine, while the threat of renewed fighting over Trans-Dniester worries Moldovan authorities. The fear is that Russia will claim it needs to intervene to protect its troops or restore order. The explosions happened in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the Ukraine border, according to the region’s Interior Ministry. No one was hurt, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows. No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts. The United States has warned amid the war in Ukraine that Russia could launch “false-flag” attacks in nearby nations as a pretext for sending in troops. On Monday, several explosions, believed to have been caused by rocket-propelled grenades, were reported to have hit the Ministry of State Security in Tiraspol, Trans-Dniester’s capital. The Security Council of Trans-Dniester reported Tuesday that there had been a total of three incidents in the region — explosions in Tiraspol on Monday, the ones in Maiac on Tuesday and damage to a military unit in the village of Parcani. Officials did not offer any details on the military unit incident. But Trans-Dniester’s president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, called Tuesday for imposing anti-terrorist security measures at a “red level” for 15 days, including setting up checkpoints at the entrances to cities. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday that the situation in Trans-Dniester “elicits concern” in Moscow. A Ukrainian presidential advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak warned in a tweet that Moldova might be attacked next, “Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chi?in?u’s gates,"" he tweeted, referring to Moldova's capital. ""Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team.” Moldovan President Maia Sandu convened the country's Supreme Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the incidents. After the meeting, she said a security analysis indicated that “different forces within the region, interested in destabilizing the situation,” carried out the blasts. The Security Council recommended ramping up border and traffic patrols, and increasing the alert level of institutions “responsible for ensuring public order and security.” “We condemn any challenges and attempts to lure the Republic of Moldova into actions that could jeopardize peace in the country,” Sandu said. “Chisinau continues to insist on a peaceful settlement of the Transnistrian conflict.” “We will take all necessary measures to prevent escalation, to strengthen the security of the state and to protect our citizens,” Sandu added. “We remain open to continue the dialogue for the settlement of the conflict in the region in a peaceful, diplomatically negotiated manner.” The U.N. said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was concerned about the reported incidents in Trans-Dniester “and urges all concerned to refrain from any statements or actions that could escalate tensions.” U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the United Nations continues to fully support efforts by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to reach a political settlement over the separatist region's status. The aim is to create a special status for Trans-Dniester while strengthening Moldova’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.",6
"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Russian President Vladimir Putin have met one-on-one for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine UNITED NATIONS -- U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Russian President Vladimir Putin met one-on-one Tuesday for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, and the United Nations said they agreed on arranging evacuations from a besieged steel plant in the battered city of Mariupol. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the Russian leader and U.N. chief discussed “proposals for humanitarian assistance and evacuation of civilians from conflict zones, namely in relation to the situation in Mariupol.” They also agreed in principle, he said, that the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross should be involved in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel complex where Ukrainian defenders in the southeastern city are making a dogged stand. Discussions will be held with the U.N. humanitarian office and the Russian Defense Ministry on the evacuation, Dujarric said. During the meeting, which the U.N. said lasted nearly two hours, Putin and Guterres sat at opposite ends of a long white table in a room with gold curtains bordered in red. No one else was at the table. Guterres criticized Russia’s military action in Ukraine as a flagrant violation of its neighbor’s territorial integrity and urged Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians trapped at the steel mill. Putin responded by claiming that Russian troops have offered humanitarian corridors to civilians holed up at the plant. But, he said, the Ukrainian defenders of the plant were using civilians as shields and not allowing them to leave. The sprawling Azovstal site has been almost completely destroyed by Russian attacks, but it is the last pocket of organized Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. An estimated 2,000 soldiers and 1,000 civilians are said to be holed up in fortified positions underneath the wrecked structures. In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday ahead of Guterres’ visit, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba noted the failure of other foreign officials who visited Moscow to achieve results, and he urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of Mariupol. “This is really something that the U.N. is capable to do,” Kuleba said. Guterres flew to Rzeszow, Poland, from Moscow late Tuesday and was met by Polish President Andrzej Duda. He is to go to Kyiv for meetings Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kuleba, and his meeting with Putin is expected to top the agenda. Many analysts have low expectations for Guterres’ diplomatic foray into the Ukraine war. But U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq was unusually optimistic Monday ahead of the Moscow meetings, telling reporters Guterres “thinks there is an opportunity now” and “will make the most” of his time on the ground talking to the leaders and see what can be achieved. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Guterres has accused the Russians of violating the U.N. Charter, which calls for peaceful settlement of disputes. He also has repeatedly called for a cessation of hostilities, most recently appealing unsuccessfully last Tuesday for a four-day “humanitarian pause” leading up to the Orthodox Easter holiday on Sunday. The U.N. crisis coordinator in Ukraine, Amin Awad, followed up Sunday by calling for an immediate halt to fighting in Mariupol to allow an estimated 100,000 trapped civilians to evacuate. Guterres said at a news conference after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier Tuesday that safe and effective humanitarian corridors are urgently needed to evacuate civilians and deliver aid. To deal with “the crisis within a crisis in Mariupol,” he proposed coordination between the U.N., Red Cross, and Ukrainian and Russian forces to enable the evacuation of civilians who want to leave “both inside and outside the Azovstal plant and in the city, in any direction they choose, and to deliver the humanitarian aid required.” The U.N. chief also proposed establishing a Humanitarian Contact Group comprising Russia, Ukraine and the United Nations “to look for opportunities for the opening of safe corridors, with local cessations of hostilities, and to guarantee that they are actually effective.” Dujarric made no mention of a broader evacuation of civilians from Mariupol or Guterres’ Humanitarian Contact Group, but getting civilians out of the steel plant would be an important step. On Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground in the plant, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.",6
"He testified about his weekend meeting with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy. Secretary Blinken testifies after trip to Ukraine Speaking publicly about his visit to Ukraine for the first time since returning home, Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday asserted ""the Ukrainians have won the battle for Kyiv,"" while calling for additional aid to help the country weather the war as the fighting shifts eastward and to the south. ""As we took the train across the border and rode westward into Ukraine, we saw mile after mile of Ukrainian countryside, territory that just a couple of months ago, the Russian government thought that it could seize in a matter of weeks. Today -- firmly Ukraine's,"" he recounted, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about his secretive visit to heart of the war-torn country with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Blinken said that on the trip, the highest-level visit to Ukraine's capital by U.S. officials since the invasion, evidence of its military success abounded. ""In Kyiv we saw the signs of a vibrant city coming back to life. People eating outside sitting on benches, strolling. It was right in front of us,"" he said. ""For all the suffering that they've endured, for all the carnage that Russia's brutal invasion continues to inflict, Ukraine was and will continue to be a free and independent country."" During the hearing, convened to review the State Department's budget for the coming fiscal year, Blinken argued that fulfilling the funding requests would prove critical to Ukraine's defense and curbing Russian aggression. ""I felt some pride in what the United States has done to support the Ukrainian government and its people and an even firmer conviction that we must not let up. Moscow's war of aggression against Ukraine has underscored the power and purpose of American diplomacy,"" he said. ""We have to continue to drive that diplomacy forward to seize what I believe are strategic opportunities, as well as address risks presented by Russia's overreach."" Blinken argued support from the U.S. and its allies had already played a decisive role. ""[The Ukrainian people's] success is primarily because of their incredible courage and determination, but it's also because we were able to equip them with what they needed,"" Blinken said. ""For every tank that the Russians have had in Ukraine, we've managed with 30 allies and partners, in one way or another, to provide about 10 anti-armor systems. For every plane that the Russians have flown in the skies, there have been about 10 anti-aircraft munitions of one kind or another."" But Blinken acknowledged that as the battleground shifted to other regions of the country, the Ukrainians' strategy needed to evolve well. ""The nature of this battle is changing, to eastern and southern Ukraine. They're adapting to that. We're adapting to that."" The secretary said while in Kyiv, he discussed what assistance Ukraine required for the next phase of the fighting with its President Zelensky and top military leader. ""I think we're largely aligned in what they say they need and what we think we're able to provide,"" he said. While the committee largely projected bipartisan support for Ukraine, the most contentious round of the hearing came during Sen. Rand Paul's line of questioning on what he called the ""reasons"" behind Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Paul, a Republican more aligned with former President Donald Trump's ""America First"" stance than the other members of his party on the committee, blamed the attack in part on President Joe Biden's and other officials' public support for Ukraine's eventual NATO membership. ""Russia said it was a red line,"" Paul stated. ""Had they been, or are they to become part of NATO, that means U.S. troops will be fighting in Ukraine and that's something I very much oppose."" ""My judgment is different,"" Blinken countered, pointing out the countries Russia had targeted -- like Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine -- were not part of NATO. ""You could also argue the countries they've attacked were part of Russia … well, we're part of the Soviet Union,"" Paul replied. ""That does not give Russia the right to attack them,"" Blinken responded. ""It is the fundamental right of these countries to decide their own future and their own destiny."" Blinken also said that in the eyes of the department, the alliance was not Russian President Vladimir Putin's chief concern ahead of the attack. ""This was never about Ukraine being potentially part of NATO,"" he said. ""It was always about his belief that Ukraine does not deserve to be a sovereign independent country that it must be re reassumed into Russia in one form or another."" Blinken was also pressed on the State Department's relatively slow-moving approach to repopulating the U.S. embassy in Kyiv after it was temporarily relocated in February, a step many of its allies have already taken. ""We are sending diplomats back to Ukraine this week, and they will begin to assess how we can most effectively and securely reopen the embassy in Kyiv. I anticipate that we will be in Lviv and then and then head to head to Kyiv, subject to the President's final decision on that,"" he said. ""We want to have our embassy reopened and we're working to do that.""",8
"Russia cut off natural gas to NATO members Poland and Bulgaria and threatened to do the same to other countries, using its most essential export as an attempt to punish and divide the West for its united support of Ukraine POKROVSK, Ukraine -- Russia cut off natural gas to NATO members Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday and threatened to do the same to other countries, using its most essential export in what was seen as a bid to punish and divide the West over its support for Ukraine. The move, condemned by European leaders as “blackmail,"" marked a dramatic escalation in the economic war of sanctions and countersanctions that has unfolded in parallel to the fighting on the battlefield. The tactic, coming a day after the U.S. and other Western allies vowed to rush more and heavier weapons to Ukraine, could eventually force targeted nations to ration gas and could deal another blow to economies suffering from rising prices. At the same time, it could deprive Russia of badly needed income to fund its war effort. Poland has been a major gateway for the delivery of weapons to Ukraine and confirmed this week that it is sending the country tanks. Just hours before Russia's state energy giant Gazprom acted, Poland announced a new set of sanctions against the company and other Russian businesses and oligarchs. Bulgaria, under a new liberal government that took office last fall, has cut many of its old ties to Moscow and likewise supported punitive measures against the Kremlin. It has also hosted Western fighter jets at a new NATO outpost on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. The gas cuts do not immediately put the two countries in any dire trouble. Poland, especially, has been working for many years to line up other suppliers, and the continent is heading into summer, making gas less essential for households. Also, Russian gas deliveries to both Poland and Bulgaria were expected to end later this year anyway. Still, the cutoff and the Kremlin warning that other countries could be next sent shivers of worry through the 27-nation European Union. Germany, the largest economy on the continent, and Italy are among Europe’s biggest consumers of Russian natural gas, though they, too, have been taking steps to reduce their dependence on Moscow. “It comes as no surprise that the Kremlin uses fossil fuels to try to blackmail us,” said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Today, the Kremlin failed once again in his attempt to sow division amongst member states. The era of Russian fossil fuel in Europe is coming to an end.” Gazprom said it shut off the two countries because they refused to pay in rubles, as President Vladimir Putin has demanded of “unfriendly"" nations. The Kremlin said other countries may be cut off if they don't agree to the payment arrangement. Most European countries have publicly balked at Russia’s demand for rubles, but it is not clear how many have actually faced the moment of decision so far. Greece’s next scheduled payment to Gazprom is due on May 25, for example, and the government must decide then whether to comply. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told his country's parliament that he believes Poland’s support for Ukraine — and the new sanctions imposed by Warsaw on Tuesday — were the real reasons behind the gas cutoff. Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov called the suspension blackmail, adding: “We will not succumb to such a racket.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia views gas as a weapon for political blackmail and ""sees a united Europe as a target.” On the battlefield, fighting continued in the country's east along a largely static front line some 300 miles (480 kilometers) long. Russia claimed its missiles hit a batch of weapons that the U.S. and European nations had delivered to Ukraine. One person was killed and at least two were injured when rockets hit a residential neighborhood in Kharkiv. Western officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings, said Russia has made slow progress in the eastern Donbas region, with “minor gains,” including the capture of villages and small towns south of Izyum and on the outskirts of Rubizhne. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, conceded that Russia has made minor progress in its advance on Rubizhne through its nearly constant bombardment, but that Ukrainian troops are fighting back and retreating only when there is nothing left to defend. “There is no point in staying on territory that has been fired on so often that every meter is well known,” he said. The Western officials said some Russian troops have been shifted from the gutted southern port city of Mariupol to other parts of the Donbas. But some remain in Mariupol to fight Ukrainian forces holed up at the Azovstal steel plant, the last stronghold in the city. About 1,000 civilians were said to be taking shelter there with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian defenders. “The situation is very difficult. There are huge problems with water, food,” Serhii Volynskyi, commander of the marine unit inside the plant, said in a Facebook video message. He said hundreds of fighters and civilians were wounded and in need of medical help, and those inside included children, older people and disabled people. In the Black Sea port city of Kherson, which Russian forces have occupied since early in the war, a series of explosions boomed late Wednesday near the television tower and at least temporarily knocked Russian channels off the air, Ukrainian and Russian news organizations reported. Just across the border in Russia, an ammunition depot in the Belgorod region burned after several explosions were heard, the governor said. Blasts were also reported in Russia's Kursk region near the border, and authorities in Russia's Voronezh region said an air defense system shot down a drone. Earlier this week, an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk was engulfed by fire. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak hinted at the country's involvement in the fires, saying in a Telegram post that “karma (is) a harsh thing.” In other developments: — The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the safety level at Europe’s largest nuclear plant, now under Russian occupation in Ukraine, is like a “red light blinking” as his organization tries in vain to get access to the Zaporizhzhia power station for repairs. — Amid rising tensions over gas, Moscow and Washington carried out a dramatic prisoner exchange, trading a Marine veteran jailed in Moscow for a convicted Russian drug trafficker serving a long prison sentence in the U.S. With the help of Western arms, Ukrainian forces managed to thwart Russian forces' attempt to storm Kyiv. Moscow now says its focus is the capture of the Donbas, Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland. A defiant Putin vowed Russia will achieve its military goals, telling parliament, ""All the tasks of the special military operation we are conducting in the Donbas and Ukraine, launched on Feb. 24, will be unconditionally fulfilled.” Simone Tagliapietra, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, said Russia’s goal in cutting off the flow of gas is to “divide and rule” — pit European countries against one another as they cast about for energy. While Poland gets around 45% of its gas from Russia, it relies overwhelmingly on coal and said it was well prepared for the cutoff. It has ample gas in storage and will soon benefit from two pipelines coming on line, analyst Emily McClain of Rystad Energy said. Bulgaria gets over 90% of its gas from Russia, but it could increase imports from Azerbaijan, and a pipeline connection to Greece is set to be completed later this year. Dobrin Todorov, a resident of Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, said the suspension is not a big problem. “Ultimately, the choice between freedom and dignity or gas, the answer is clear, in favor of freedom and dignity,” Todorov said, adding that a lack of gas ""cannot be compared to the hardship and tribulations that the Ukrainian people are currently suffering.” Europe is not without its own leverage, since it is paying some $400 million a day to Russia for gas, money Putin would lose in a complete cutoff. Russia can, in theory, sell oil elsewhere — to India and China, for instance. But it doesn't have the necessary pipelines in some cases, and it has only limited capacity to export gas by ship. “The move that Russia did today is basically a move where Russia hurts itself,"" von der Leyen said. ——— Gambrell reported from Lviv, Ukraine, and Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

"Polish and Bulgarian leaders have accused Moscow of using natural gas to blackmail their countries WARSAW, Poland -- Polish and Bulgarian leaders accused Moscow of using natural gas to blackmail their countries after Russia's state-controlled energy company said it would stop supplying the two European nations Wednesday. The gas cutoff came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that “unfriendly” countries would need to start paying for gas in rubles, Russia's currency, which Bulgaria and Poland refused to do. Russian energy giant Gazprom said in a statement that it hadn’t received any payments from Poland and Bulgaria since April 1 and was suspending their deliveries starting Wednesday. If the countries siphon off gas intended for other European customers, deliveries to Europe will be reduced by that amount, the company said. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Poland's parliament that he thinks the suspension was revenge for new sanctions against Russia that Warsaw imposed over the war in Ukraine. Morawiecki vowed that Poland would not be cowed by the cutoff. He said the country was safe from an energy crisis thanks to years of efforts to secure gas from other countries. Lawmakers stood and applauded when he said that Russia’s “gas blackmail” would have no effect on Poland. The new sanctions, announced Tuesday, targeted 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom. Hours later, Poland said it had received notice that Gazprom was cutting off its gas supplies for failing to adhere to the demand to pay in Russian rubles. Poland’s gas company, PGNiG, said the gas supplies from the Yamal pipeline stopped early Wednesday, as Gazprom had warned they would. Bulgaria said Tuesday that it also was informed by Gazprom that the country's gas supplies would end at the same time. Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov called Gazprom’s suspension of gas deliveries to his country “a gross violation of their contract"" and “blackmail.” “We will not succumb to such a racket,” he added. Russia's move raised wider concerns that other countries could be targeted next as Western countries increase their support for Ukraine amid a war now in its third month. European Union officials were holding emergency talks on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the announcement by Gazprom “is yet another attempt by Russia to use gas as an instrument of blackmail.” The Greek government was to hold its own emergency meeting in Athens. Greece's next scheduled payment to Gazprom is due on May 25, and the government must decide whether it will comply with the demand to complete the transaction in rubles. Greece is ramping up its liquefied natural gas storage capacity, and has contingency plans to switch several industry sectors from gas to diesel as an emergency energy source. It has also reversed a program to reduce domestic coal production over the next two years. Europe is not without leverage in the dispute; at current prices, it pays Russia some $400 million a day for gas, money Putin would lose with a complete cutoff. Russia can in theory sell its oil elsewhere, such as to India and China, because oil primarily moves by ship. But the gas pipeline network that carries gas from the huge deposits in northwestern Siberia's Yamal Peninsula does not connect with pipelines that run to China. And Russia only has limited facilities to export super chilled liquefied gas by ship. Russian gas made up some 45% of Poland's overall gas usage until the cutoff. But Poland is far more reliant on coal to heat homes and fuel industry, with gas making up around 7% of the country's overall energy mix. Russian supplies to Poland already were expected to end later this year anyway. Poland has worked for many years to secure supplies from other countries. Several years ago, the country opened its first terminal for liquefied natural gas, or LNG, in Swinoujscie, on the Baltic Sea coast. A pipeline from Norway is to due to start operating this year. In Bulgaria, the main consumers of gas are district heating companies, and only about 120,000 households rely on gas. Bulgaria's energy minister said his country can meet the needs of users for at least one month. “Alternative supplies are available, and Bulgaria hopes that alternative routes and supplies will also be secured at the EU level,” Energy Minister Alexander Nikolov said. Fatih Birol, the head of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, described Russia's move as a “weaponization of energy supplies.” He said Russia’s decision “makes it clearer than ever that Europe needs to move quickly to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.” ——— Toshkov reported from Bulgaria.

"The White House is taking action to increase access to antiviral treatments. White House announces expanded access to antiviral pills for COVID-19 As mask mandates are lifted, and mitigation measures are increasingly dropped across the nation, a stark reality continues to hinder the nation's return to a pre-pandemic sense of normality. Hundreds of Americans are still losing their lives to COVID-19 every day. However, with the growing availability of coronavirus vaccines and antiviral treatments, many health experts assert that, given the United States' tremendous medical advancements in the fight against the virus at this point in time, few Americans should still be dying of COVID-19. ""It should be pretty close to 'no one,'' Dr. Shira Doron, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, told ABC News. Infectious disease experts say that the vast majority of those still dying are the unvaccinated. In February, unvaccinated adults were 10 times more likely to die of COVID-19 compared to vaccinated individuals and five times more likely to require hospitalization. When compared to fully vaccinated and boosted adults, unvaccinated people were about 20 times more likely to die of COVID-19 and seven times more likely to require hospitalization. ""We have vaccines that, for people with normal immune systems, are about 90% effective at preventing hospitalization, and, for those who get COVID-19 and have even a single risk factor for progression to severe disease, we have treatments, like Paxlovid and Bebtelovimab, that are 90% effective at preventing progression to hospitalization,"" Doron said. ""Add those together and not only should no one be dying, but no one should be getting hospitalized, if we are using those tools as we should."" Despite widespread medical approval of the drugs, federal officials say that many of those resources, in more than ample supply, are not being used as widely as they should be, and as a result, thousands of lives are being unnecessarily lost. On Tuesday, the White House announced that it would take new actions to increase access to Paxlovid, Pfizer's antiviral COVID-19 pill. ""We now have more tools than ever before to protect people from the virus, including highly effective treatments,"" the Biden administration said in a statement Tuesday. Paxlovid, which reduces the risk of hospitalization and death by 90%, currently gets prescribed to about 55,000 Americans a week, which is about 2.5 times more than a month ago. But over the past week, the U.S. has seen an average of 44,000 new infections each day. The administration's plan is to double the number of pharmacies that stock the drug to 40,000 sites nationwide in the coming weeks, as it was previously limited to 20,000 due to insufficient supply. Officials will also work to provide physicians with more guidance and tools to understand and prescribe the treatments. Despite the plan to increase the availability of critical drugs to combat COVID-19, some health experts are concerned that it will still not be enough to save lives, given the many barriers that stand in the way of ensuring that those drugs and treatments are widely accessible to all those who need them. Although therapeutics and vaccines will be important tools to prevent serious illness and deaths, experts say decreasing the number of daily COVID-19 fatalities will also be a function of equitably increasing access to these preventive measures and treatments. ""Equitable access is a huge barrier at this point in time, especially to effective treatments such as Paxlovid,"" Colleen Kelley, an associate professor in the division of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine, told ABC News. Lack of access to transportation to proper pharmacies can have major consequences for public health. According to ABC News' analysis last summer of pharmacy locations across the country, there are 150 counties where there is no pharmacy, and nearly 4.8 million people live in a county where there's only one pharmacy for every 10,000 residents or more. Based on Census data, there are far fewer pharmacies per person -- especially chain pharmacies -- in rural parts of the country compared to urban areas. In addition, the access inequities underscore the racial gap prevalent throughout the country in both rural and urban areas, with more pharmacies per person in whiter and wealthier neighborhoods than in poorer, predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods. Persisting disparities throughout the pandemic have also resulted in a higher likelihood of death from COVID-19 for Black and brown Americans. According to federal data, adjusted for age and population, the likelihood of death because of COVID-19 for Black, Asian, Latino and Native American people is about one to two times higher, compared to white Americans. Although some minority communities initially lagged behind in the nation's vaccination efforts, the rates of Black and brown Americans have significantly caught up proportionally to their respective populations. A recent report, produced by the Poor People's Campaign in collaboration with the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network, also revealed the ""devastating and disproportionate"" impact of the virus on low-income communities in the U.S. The report found that death rates in the lowest income group were double the death rates of those in the highest income group ""Widespread equitable access would drive hospitalization and death rates way down,"" Doron said, adding that not enough individuals know that treatments are available and end up in the hospital. ""Those who are more medically literate and do their own research know how important it is to suspect COVID at the first sign of symptoms, have easier access to testing, and know to call their doctor for a prescription for an antiviral or for an infusion of monoclonal antibody or remdesivir,"" Doron said. Education pertaining to treatments as well as widespread, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests and effective treatments are critical to boosting our way out of the pandemic by ultimately driving down hospitalizations and death rates, Dr. Jay Bhatt, an internist and adjunct faculty at the UIC School of Public Health, told ABC News. ""This would likely reduce spread and cases of chronic disease triggered by COVID-19 infection and likely hospitalizations and death,"" Bhatt said. Equitable access to drugs also remains critical for the millions of Americans, who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, and thus have a weakened immune system, putting them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness and death, according to the CDC. According to physicians, a large proportion of the few fully vaccinated Americans who are getting breakthrough infections and dying are those with underlying conditions or those who are being treated with immunosuppressive drugs. ""There may be a small number of individuals with chronic disease and those that are immunocompromised infected with COVID-19 that may not survive infection even though they have had appropriate treatments and be vaccinated. It is also possible that COVID-19 flares chronic conditions that may lead to complications and death,"" Bhatt said. Matthew Cortland, a disability rights advocate, stressed the importance of getting those drugs to those at higher risk. ""If you are at higher risk, having a reduced viral load can only benefit you,"" Cortland said. ""There's still a shortage and a scarcity mindset. Paxlovid has to be readily available basically everywhere."" The push to make treatments more widely available only further underscores the need for COVID-19 funding, Cortland added. ""Congress will need to fund more purchases"" of these treatments, Cortland said. ""That's the only way that we get to as few COVID deaths as possible.""",6
"A British court has ruled that the Conservative government acted illegally when it discharged hospital patients into nursing homes without testing them for COVID-19 or isolating them On Location: April 27, 2022 LONDON -- A British court ruled Wednesday that the Conservative government acted illegally when it discharged hospital patients into nursing homes without testing them for COVID-19 or isolating them — a policy that led to thousands of deaths early in the pandemic. Two High Court judges said the policy in March and April 2020 was unlawful because it failed to take into account the infection risk that non-symptomatic carriers of the virus posed to older or vulnerable people. The judges said U.K. officials did not take into account the “growing awareness” that the virus could be spread by people who had no symptoms, which had been identified as a risk as far back as late January 2020. They said the U.K. government should have advised that discharged hospital patients be kept separate from other nursing home residents for 14 days — something that didn't happen in the first weeks of the country's outbreak. Around 20,000 people died with the virus in British nursing homes during the initial months of the country’s first outbreak in 2020. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by two women whose fathers died when the virus swept through the homes where they lived. Their lawyers said the decision — which allowed COVID-19 to spread among the elderly and vulnerable — was “one of the most egregious and devastating policy failures in the modern era.” The judges backed some parts of the lawsuit's arguments but rejected claims made under human rights legislation and against the National Health Service. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would study the ruling and respond “in due course.” He said officials had to make difficult decisions at an “incredibly difficult time” when “we didn’t know very much about the disease.” “The thing we didn’t know in particular was that COVID could be transmitted asymptomatically in the way that it was, and that was something that I wish we had known more about at the time,” Johnson said in the House of Commons. “Of course, I want to renew my apologies and sympathies for all those who lost loved ones during the pandemic, people who lost loved ones in care homes,"" he added. Like many countries, the U.K. had little capacity to test for coronavirus when the pandemic began, and many asymptomatic patients were quickly released from hospitals back into care homes, where COVID-19 soon ran riot. The health secretary at the time, Matt Hancock, has said the government did all it could to keep people safe during the biggest public health crisis in decades. Hancock’s office said in a statement that the court ruling cleared him of wrongdoing and found he ""acted reasonably on all counts.” It said Hancock — who quit the government last year for breaching pandemic social-distancing rules by having an affair while living with his wife — wished health officials had told him sooner all they knew about asymptomatic transmission. Claimant Cathy Gardner, whose father died in April 2020, said “my father and other residents of care homes were neglected and let down by the government.” “Matt Hancock’s claim that the government threw a protective ring round care homes in the first wave of the pandemic was nothing more than a despicable lie of which he ought to be ashamed and for which he ought to apologize,” Gardner said. Johnson has set up an independent public inquiry into Britain’s handling of the pandemic, though it has yet to begin. More than 174,000 people have died in Britain after testing positive for the virus, the highest toll in Europe after Russia. Helen Wildbore, director of the Relatives and Residents Association charity, said the ruling “confirms what people living in care and their families have known all along – the protective ring was non-existent.” “The ruling is very welcome as a first step to justice but bereaved families will be left asking why more wasn’t done to protect their loved ones and how many lives could have been saved,"" she said. ——— Follow all AP stories on the pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic.",6
"Poland and Bulgaria  have accused Moscow of using natural gas to blackmail their countries On Location: April 27, 2022 WARSAW, Poland -- Polish and Bulgarian leaders accused Moscow of using natural gas to blackmail their countries after Russia's state-controlled energy company stopped supplying them with gas Wednesday. European Union leaders echoed those comments and were holding an emergency meeting on the Russian move. The gas cutoff to Poland and Bulgaria came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that “unfriendly” countries would need to start paying for gas in rubles, Russia's currency, which Bulgaria and Poland refused to do. Russian energy giant Gazprom said in a statement that it hadn’t received any payments from Poland and Bulgaria since April 1 and was suspending their deliveries starting Wednesday. And if those countries siphon off Russian gas intended for other European customers, Gazprom said deliveries to Europe will be reduced by that amount. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the announcement by Gazprom “is yet another attempt by Russia to use gas as an instrument of blackmail.” Europe is not without some leverage in the dispute, since it pays Russia $400 million a day for gas, money Putin would lose with a complete cutoff. Russia, however, rejected the idea that it was using blackmail while warning it may halt gas supplies to other European customers if they also refuse to switch to paying in rubles. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, argued that the Russian demand to switch to paying for gas in rubles resulted from Western actions that froze Russian hard currency assets. He said those were effectively “stolen” by the West in an “unprecedented unfriendly action.” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Poland's parliament that he thinks the suspension was revenge for new sanctions against Russia that Warsaw imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Morawiecki called it an “attack on Poland” and an example of “gas imperialism” while vowing that Poland would not be cowed by the cutoff. He said the country was safe from an energy crisis thanks to years of efforts to secure gas from other countries. “We will not succumb to Russia's gas blackmail,” he told lawmakers, to applause. He also sought to assure citizens that the gas cutoff would not affect Polish households. Some Poles and Bulgarians welcomed the cutoff for moving them closer to independence from Russian energy. ""I don’t know what the results will be for regular citizens like myself,” said Nina Rudnicka, a lecturer at Poznan University. “But I believe that one should not bow to Russia’s blackmail. It was the right decision not to change to payment in rubles.” Dobrin Todorov, a resident of Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, said given a “choice between freedom and dignity or gas, the answer is clear, in favor of freedom and dignity."" ""So we will go through this ordeal. It cannot be compared to the hardship and tribulations that the Ukrainian people are currently suffering,” Todorov added. The new Polish sanctions against Russia, announced Tuesday, targeted 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom. Hours later, Poland said it had received notice that Gazprom was cutting off its gas supplies for failing to pay in Russian rubles. Poland’s gas company, PGNiG, said the gas supplies from the Yamal pipeline stopped early Wednesday. Russian gas supplies to both Poland and Bulgaria already were expected to end later this year anyway. Poland relies on coal for 70% of its energy needs, with gas only making up around 7% of its energy mix. Several years ago, the country opened its first terminal for liquefied natural gas, or LNG, in Swinoujscie, on the Baltic Sea coast. A pipeline from Norway is to due to start operating this year. Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, whose government has been cutting many of the country's old ties with Russia, called Gazprom’s suspension of gas deliveries “a gross violation of their contract” and “blackmail.” He vowed to defend the country's interests and “support military-technical assistance to Ukraine.” “Unfortunately, in the recent past we were treated as Russia’s fifth column. And there are many political and economic circles that protect Russia’s interests,"" he said. “We and our party will protect only Bulgarian interests.” In Bulgaria, the main consumers of gas are district heating companies. Bulgaria’s energy minister said his country can meet the needs of users for at least one month. “Alternative supplies are available, and Bulgaria hopes that alternative routes and supplies will also be secured at the EU level,” Energy Minister Alexander Nikolov said. Russia's move raised wider concerns that other countries could be targeted next as Western countries increase their support for Ukraine amid a war now in its third month. The Greek government held an emergency meeting Wednesday in Athens. Greece's next scheduled payment to Gazprom is due on May 25, and the government must decide whether it will comply with the demand to pay in rubles. Greece is ramping up its liquefied natural gas storage capacity, and has contingency plans to switch several industry sectors from gas to diesel as an emergency energy source. It has also reversed a program to reduce domestic coal production. “It appears there is some posturing by Gazprom,’’ said Gianna Bern a University of Notre Dame finance professor. “There are probably fewer consequences to turning off natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria than larger countries in Europe. Russia is definitely sending a message.” If European nations decide not to pay in rubles, Russia can sell its oil elsewhere, such as to India and China, because oil primarily moves by ship. It has less options with natural gas, because the pipeline network that carries gas from Russia’s huge deposits in northwestern Siberia’s Yamal Peninsula does not connect with pipelines that run to China. And Russia only has limited facilities to export super-chilled liquefied gas by ship. ——— Toshkov reported from Bulgaria.

"The investigation was spurred by the death of George Floyd in May 2020. Investigation finds Minneapolis police engaged in racial discrimination Following an almost two-year investigation, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights found that the city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of race discrimination in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act. The human rights agency said Wednesday it will work with the city to develop a consent decree -- ""a court-enforceable agreement that identifies specific changes to be made and timelines for those changes to occur."" The investigation found racial disparities in how ""MPD officers use force, stop, search, arrest, and cite people of color; in MPD officers' use of covert social media to surveil Black individuals and Black organizations, unrelated to criminal activity; MPD officers' consistent use of racist, misogynistic, and disrespectful language."" These conclusions were made after investigators sat through hundreds of hours of camera footage, official interviews with officers, experts and witnesses, and read through thousands of pages in documents and materials. The Department of Human Rights said it will meet with community members, MPD officers, city officials and others to get feedback in preparation for the consent decree to address racial discrimination in policing in the city. The investigation is aimed at determining whether MPD engages in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, the state's civil rights law. The human rights department filing came shortly after the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Chauvin was convicted of the killing April 20, 2021. ""Community leaders have been asking for structural change for decades,"" Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said in June 2020 during the department's announcement. ""They have fought for this and it is essential that we acknowledge the work and the commitment of those who have paved the path to make today's announcement possible."" Attorney Ben Crump and co-counsels Antonio Romanucci and Jeff Storms, the legal team that represents Floyd's family, called the findings ""historic."" ""We hope this leads to placing the city and the police department under a state-ordered consent decree, which would give us assurance, at last, that real change in policing is possible, and Minneapolis can become a safer city for its Black residents,"" they said in a statement. It continued, ""We call on city, state, and Police leaders to accept the challenge of these findings and make meaningful change at last to create trust between communities of color in Minneapolis and those who are sworn to protect and serve them."" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department also opened a pattern or practice investigation into the city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department in 2021. That investigation is still ongoing. The Department of Human Rights obtained a temporary court order from Hennepin County District Court in June 2020 that forced the city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department to implement immediate policy changes. MPD was required to ban chokeholds, officers were required to report or intervene in unauthorized use of force by other officers, get police chief approval on crowd control weapon use and more. Since the start of the human rights investigation, groups like the Minnesota Justice Center, the Policing Project at NYU Law and the Minneapolis Foundation have offered recommendations for MPD in independent reviews on the department.",3
"Ukraine’s leader has accused Russia of trying to humiliate the United Nations by raining missiles on Kyiv during a visit by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres President Biden gives remarks on the war in Ukraine  KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine’s leader accused Russia of trying to humiliate the United Nations by raining missiles on Kyiv during a visit by Secretary-General António Guterres, an attack that shattered the capital's tentative return to normality as the focus of the war moved east. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s forces were holding off Russia's attempted advance in the south and east, as efforts continued to secure safe passage for residents trapped in Mariupol, which has been largely reduced to rubble in a 2-month-long siege. Russia pounded targets all over Ukraine on Thursday, including the attack on Kyiv that struck a residential high-rise and another building. U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty said its journalist Vira Hyrych, who lives in one of the buildings hit, died. Her body was found in the rubble on Friday. Ten people were wounded in the attack, including at least one who lost a leg, according to Ukraine's emergency services. In an apparent reference to the same strike, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Friday that it had destroyed “production buildings” at the Artem defense factory in Kyiv. The attack on Kyiv came barely an hour after Zelenskyy held a news conference with Guterres, who toured some of the destruction in and around Kyiv and condemned attacks on civilians during his visit. “This says a lot about Russia’s true attitude towards global institutions, about attempts of Russian authorities to humiliate the U.N. and everything that the organization represents,” Zelenskyy said in an overnight video address to the nation. ""Therefore, it requires corresponding powerful reaction.” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko derided the attack as equivalent to Russian President Vladimir Putin showing Guterres “his middle finger.” The strikes were the boldest Russian bombardment of the capital since Moscow’s forces retreated weeks ago following their failure to take the city in what they hoped would be a lightning offensive. Instead, stiff Ukrainian resistance, bolstered by Western arms, stalled Putin's advance and forced his troops to pull back to regroup. Some have now started to push into the country's eastern industrial heartland of the Donbas, which Moscow now says is its focus. Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in the east has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Both Ukraine and the Moscow-backed rebels fighting in the east also have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone. But so far, Russia’s troops and the separatist forces appear to have made only minor gains, and Britain’s Defense Ministry said Friday that those have been achieved at significant cost to Russia's forces. One aim of Guterres' visit was to secure the evacuation of people from the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, including a shattered steelworks where Ukrainian defenders are holed up and hundreds of civilians are also sheltering, Previous evacuation attempts have collapsed. “I cannot confirm the exact details of the operation to make sure it is done with safety for our people and for civilians stranded in Mariupol” said Saviano Abreu, a spokesperson for the U.N.’s humanitarian office. An official in Zelenskyy’s office said negotiations were underway with U.N. mediation, and did not rule out an evacuation of the plant happening Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Mariupol has seen some of the most dramatic suffering of the war. Under siege since the early days of the invasion, many of its residents became trapped with scarce access to food, water, medicine or electricity. An estimated 100,000 people are believed to still be in the city, and the city council warned Thursday that a lack of safe drinking water or a working sewer system could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and dysentery. It added that bodies lay decaying under the rubble. Russian forces largely control the city, but some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are holed up at the steel plant, the last known pocket of resistance. About 1,000 civilians are with them, and the fighters said recent concentrated bombings killed and wounded people. Video posted online by Ukraine’s Azov Regiment inside the steel plant showed people combing through the rubble to remove the dead and help the wounded. The regiment said the Russians hit an improvised underground hospital and its operating room, killing an unspecified number of people. The video couldn’t be independently verified. Russia’s invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24 upended the post-Cold War security order. Putin, long irked by NATO’s expansion to eastern Europe, says the operation seeks the “demilitarization” of Ukraine, aims to protect people in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas and ensure Russia’s own security. One of Moscow's demands has been that Ukraine drop its bid to join the western NATO alliance. Ukraine and the West say it was an unprovoked and illegal invasion launched to topple the government in Kyiv. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote Friday on Twitter that a “security vacuum” had led to the war. “We have then been knocking on NATO’s door, but it never opened,” he wrote. “The world owes Ukraine security, and we ask states to decide which security guarantees they are ready to provide.” A day after Russia pounded a wide area of Ukraine, the governor of Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said two towns there were hit by Russian Grad rockets on Friday. There was no immediate word on casualties or damage. Separately, the governor of Russia’s Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said that a border post came under mortar fire from Ukraine and that Russian border forces returned fire. He said there were no casualties on the Russian side. Thursday's explosions in northwestern Kyiv’s Shevchenkivsky district shook the city and flames poured out the windows of the residential high-rise and another building. The capital had been relatively unscathed in recent weeks, and cafes and other businesses have started to reopen, while a growing numbers of people have been out and about, enjoying the spring weather. The terrible human cost of the war, which has driven more than 11 million Ukrainians from their homes, continues to climb. In Lyman, a town in Donetsk where Russian forces are reportedly trying to advance as part of their Donbas push, shells rained on Tatiana Maksagory’s home this week, devastating her family. Maksagory’s 14-year-old grandson, Igor, was declared dead after emergency services drove him to the hospital. Her daughter was in serious condition and her son-in-law was also killed. “Grandma, will I live?“ she said Igor asked her when they were in the basement waiting for help. “I said that he would live. But look what happened, I betrayed him.” ——— This story has been updated to correct that Thursday’s strike on Kyiv was the boldest attack since Moscow’s retreat, not necessarily the first. ——— Associated Press journalists Jon Gambrell and Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Mstyslav Chernov in Kharkiv, Yesica Fisch in Sloviansk, and AP staff around the world contributed to this report. ——— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",9
"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged a rapid halt to fighting in Ukraine on Friday and said they will work together to improve humanitarian conditions there JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged a rapid halt to fighting in Ukraine on Friday and said they will work together to improve humanitarian conditions there. “The Ukraine war must be stopped immediately and we agree to create a conducive situation so that negotiations and a peaceful solution can be reached quickly” Widodo said after meeting with Kishida in Jakarta. Indonesia is Kishida’s first stop on an eight-day trip that will also take him to Vietnam, Thailand, Italy and the United Kingdom. Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""shook the foundations of the international order, including in Asia, and it must be strongly condemned,” Kishida said. Kishida and Widodo also discussed Indonesia’s role as current chair of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations. “We will use Indonesia’s leadership of the G-20 as a catalyst for a humanitarian response and world economic recovery,” Widodo said. Widodo announced Friday that he has invited both Ukraine President Volodymr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend the G-20 leaders' summit in Bali in November. He said Putin agreed to attend but it was unclear whether it would be in person or virtually. It was not immediately known whether Zelenskyy would attend. Widodo also said he rejected a request from the Ukrainian leader for weapons from Indonesia. “The mandate of Indonesia’s Constitution and the principles of our foreign policy prohibit providing arms to other countries,” Widodo said. “However, we are ready to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine.” “I reiterated the importance of ending the war immediately,” he said. “I also emphasized that peaceful efforts should continue and Indonesia is ready to contribute to these peaceful efforts,” he said in televised remarks. Indonesia is hoping for additional Japanese investment, especially in energy, cement, agricultural technology and health, and that Japan will make Indonesia an important part of the global supply chain for its industries, Widodo said. Japan is Indonesia’s third largest export destination and fifth largest investor. Cooperation between the two countries includes the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit system and Patimban Port in West Java province.",9
"""It's hard to look at what he's doing,"" John Kirby said. Pentagon press sec. John Kirby gets emotional over Ukraine images  In a rare show of emotion at the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby choked up discussing Russian President Vladimir Putin and alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine during a briefing with reporters Friday. It began when Kirby was asked whether he believes Putin is a ""rational actor."" ""It's hard to look at what he's doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine, and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that. It's difficult to look at the –"" Kirby said, cutting off his sentence as he looked away to collect himself. After eight seconds of silence behind the podium, he continued. ""Sorry,"" he said. ""It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious, mature leader would do that. So, I can't talk to his psychology, but I think we can all speak to his depravity."" Later in the briefing, he apologized for the charged moment. ""I didn't mean to get emotional, I apologize for that. I don't want to make this about me. But I've been around the military a long, long time and I've known friends who didn't make it back. It's just hard,"" Kirby said. Kirby then redoubled his attack on Putin and the brutality he said has been carried out by his military -- accusations the Russians deny -- his demeanor visibly shifting from sorrowful to indignant. ""It's hard to square his, let's just call it what it is, his BS – that this is about Nazism in Ukraine, and it's about protecting Russians in Ukraine, and it's about defending Russian national interests, when none of them, none of them were threatened by Ukraine,"" he said, slamming his right hand to the podium to emphasize the final words. ""It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people. Shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs. Women, pregnant women being killed. Hospitals being bombed. I mean, it's just unconscionable. And I don't know ... I don't have the mental capacity to understand how you connect those two things. It's just beyond me,"" he said. He closed with a final apology. ""I'm just a spokesman,"" he said. ""I'm not qualified to make an assessment one way or the other, and I do apologize for injecting my personal perspective here.""",3
"A new report revealed accusations of political interference against HHS. Birx grilled over not speaking out on Trump, COVID-19 In closed-door testimony to House investigators released on Friday, Dr. Bob Redfield, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, former President Donald Trump appointees repeatedly blocked his public health experts from briefing the American public. Redfield described, in detail, efforts by the CDC to speak publicly on what it knew about COVID and how people could stay safe. ""They would not clear our briefings,"" Redfield said, according to written excerpts of the interview. ""This is one of my great disappointments. That HHS basically took over total clearance of briefings by CDC."" Further, Redfield said he believed the consequences of CDC's inability to provide information to the public during that period, impacted the trust of the American public on the agency. He called his replacement, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, after she was picked for the job, and promised he would never jump on the evening television shows and criticize her. ""I called her when she got nominated. The one thing she wasn't going to hear from me was public criticism. I got it every night from my predecessors on the nightly news. I said I'm not going to do that to you. That is tough job. I'm here to help. Call me if you can,"" Redfield said. Prior to Redfield's comments, last week, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a new report detailing accusations from staffers of political interference against the agencies within HHS, including the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Interviewees reported, through a confidential hotline, that they had witnessed instances of political interference occur, but did not report them for various reasons, including fear of retaliation, a lack of knowledge on how to report the issues, or a belief that their leaders were already aware of the issues. Some respondents from the CDC and FDA said they felt that the potential political interference they observed, had resulted in the ""alteration"" or ""suppression"" of scientific findings. Other interviewees reported that they believed the potential political interference that they had witnessed, may have resulted in the ""politically motivated alteration of public health guidance or delayed publication of COVID-19-related scientific findings."" In one instance, in May 2020, a senior official from the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response claimed that HHS retaliated against him for disclosing ""concerns about inappropriate political interference to make chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine available to the public as treatments for COVID-19,"" GAO officials wrote in the report. The report, which stated that the agencies had not reported any formal internal allegations of potential political interference from 2010 through 2021, found that the federal health agencies do not have appropriate procedures in place that ""define political interference in scientific decision-making."" Although all four agencies train staff on some scientific-integrity-related topics, the NIH is the only agency that provides guidance on political interference. According to GAO officials, who concluded their audit through April 2022, HHS concurred with the recommendations to develop procedures and training for reporting these allegations of political interference.",6
"Two Ukrainian women whose husbands are defending a besieged steel plant in the southern city of Mariupol are calling for any evacuation of civilians to also include soldiers ROME -- Two Ukrainian women whose husbands are defending a besieged steel plant in the southern city of Mariupol are calling for any evacuation of civilians to also include soldiers, saying they fear the troops will be tortured and killed if left behind and captured by Russian forces. “The lives of soldiers matter too. We can’t only talk about civilians,” said Yuliia Fedusiuk, 29, the wife of Arseniy Fedusiuk, a member of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol. “We are hoping that we can rescue soldiers too, not only dead, not only injured, but all of them.” She and Kateryna Prokopenko, whose husband, Denys Prokopenko, is the Azov commander, made their appeal in Rome on Friday for international assistance to evacuate the Azovstal plant, the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the strategic and now bombed-out port city. An estimated 2,000 Ukrainian defenders and 1,000 civilians are holed up in the plant's vast underground network of bunkers, which are able to withstand airstrikes. But conditions there have grown more dire, with food, water and medicine running out, after Russian forces dropped “bunker busters” and other munitions in recent days. The United Nations has said Secretary-General António Guterres and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on arranging evacuations from the plant during a meeting this week in Moscow, with the U.N. and International Committee of the Red Cross involved. But the discussions as reported by the U.N. concerned civilians, not combatants. Speaking in English, Prokopenko, 27, called for a Dunkirk-style mission, a reference to the World War II maritime operation launched to rescue British and Allied troops surrounded by German forces in northern France. “We can do this extraction operation ... which will save our soldiers, our civilians, our kids,” she said. “We need to do this right now, because people — every hour, every second — are dying.” The women said 600 of the soldiers are wounded with some suffering from gangrene. They provided grisly videos and photos sent by their husbands of men with amputated limbs, bullet wounds and other injuries. They said people are eating porridge, old cheese and rudimentary bread. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed in 2014 by far-right activists at the start of the conflict in the east between Ukraine and Moscow-backed separatists, and which has elicited criticism for its tactics. Fedusiuk said she and Prokopenko were seeking help from Europe, the United States and international organizations to find a diplomatic resolution to the Azovstal standoff. And she said the troops would never surrender to Russian capture. “We don’t know any Azov soldier who came (back) alive from Russian soldiers, from 2014, so they will be tortured and killed,” Fedusiuk said. ""We know that definitely, so it is not an option for them.” ——— Associated Press writer Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.",3
"U.S. Sen. Rand Paul has promised to wage a vigorous review into the origins of the coronavirus if Republicans retake the Senate and he lands a committee chairmanship SMITHFIELD, Ky. -- U.S. Sen. Rand Paul promised Saturday to wage a vigorous review into the origins of the coronavirus if Republicans retake the Senate and he lands a committee chairmanship. Speaking to supporters at a campaign rally, the libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican denounced what he sees as government overreach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He applauded a recent judge’s order that voided the federal mask mandate on planes and trains and in travel hubs. ""Last week I was on an airplane for the first time in two years and didn’t have to wear a mask,” he said, drawing cheers from the partisan crowd. “And you know what I saw in the airport? I saw at least 97% of the other free individuals not wearing masks.” Paul has clashed repeatedly with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, over the government's COVID-19 policies and the origins of the virus that caused the global pandemic. Paul, who is seeking a third term this year in Kentucky, said he's in line to assume a committee chairmanship if the GOP wins Senate control after the November election. The Senate currently has a 50-50 split, but Democrats have the slim edge because Vice President Kamala Harris is a tie-breaking vote. “When we take over in November, I will be chairman of a committee and I will have subpoena power,” Paul said. “And we will get to the bottom of where this virus came from.” The senator, an eye surgeon, continued to offer his theory about the origins of the virus. ""If you look at the evidence, overwhelmingly, not 100%, but overwhelmingly the evidence points to this virus being a leak from a lab,” Paul said. In the U.S., many conservatives have accused Chinese scientists of developing COVID-19 in a lab and allowing it to leak. U.S. intelligence agencies remain divided on the origins of the coronavirus but believe China’s leaders did not know about the virus before the start of the global pandemic, according a Biden-ordered review that was released last summer. The scientific consensus remains that the virus most likely migrated from animals in what’s known as a zoonotic transmission. So-called “spillover events” occur in nature, and there are at least two coronaviruses that evolved in bats and caused human epidemics, SARS1 and MERS. At the Kentucky GOP rally for Paul, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, the state's senior senator, also pointed to Paul's opportunity to lead a committee if the GOP wins Senate control. If that occurs, he said, Paul would become chairman of “one of the most important committees in the Senate — in charge of health, education, labor and pensions.” McConnell was upbeat about Republican prospects in November. “I've never seen a better environment for us than this year,” said McConnell, who is in line to again become majority leader if the GOP reclaims the Senate. The rally featured a number of other prominent Kentucky Republicans, including several who are considering running for governor in 2023, when Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear will seek a second term. In his speech, Paul continued to rail against socialism, saying it would encroach on individual liberties. The senator was first elected to the Senate in the tea party-driven wave of 2010. “When President Trump said he wanted to ‘Make America Great Again,’ I said, ‘Amen,’"" Paul said. ""But let’s understand what made America great in the first place, and that’s freedom, constitutionally guaranteed liberty.” In this year's Senate race in Kentucky, Charles Booker is by far the best known of a handful of Democrats seeking their party's nomination for Paul's seat in the May 17 primary. Paul is being challenged by several little-known candidates in the GOP primary. A general election campaign between Paul and Booker would be a battle between candidates with starkly different philosophies. Booker, a Black former state lawmaker, narrowly lost a bid for the Senate Democratic nomination in 2020. He is a progressive who touts Medicare for all, anti-poverty programs, a clean-energy agenda and criminal justice changes. Paul, a former presidential candidate, has accumulated a massive fundraising advantage over Booker. Kentucky has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since Wendell Ford in 1992.",6
"A former U.S. Marine who died last week in Ukraine was believed to be the first American citizen killed while fighting there Speaker Pelosi meets Zelenskyy in unannounced visit to Kyiv Harrison Jozefowicz quit his job as a Chicago police officer and headed overseas soon after Russia invaded Ukraine. An Army veteran, he said he couldn't help but join American volunteers seeking to help Ukrainians in their fight. Jozefowicz now heads a group called Task Force Yankee, which he said has placed more than 190 volunteers in combat slots and other roles while delivering nearly 15,000 first aid kits, helping relocate more than 80 families and helping deliver dozens of pallets of food and medical supplies to the southern and eastern fronts of the war. It's difficult, dangerous work. But Jozefowicz said he felt helpless watching from the United States last year during the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan, particularly after a close friend, Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss, died in a suicide bombing at Kabul. ""So, I’m just trying to do everything I can to make sure I can help others not go through what I went through,” he said Saturday during an interview conducted through a messaging platform. A former U.S. Marine who died last week was believed to be the first American citizen killed while fighting in Ukraine. Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, died Monday while working for a military contracting company that sent him to Ukraine, his mother, Rebecca Cabrera, told CNN. An undetermined number of other Americans — many with military backgrounds — are thought to be in the country battling Russian forces beside both Ukrainians and volunteers from other countries even though U.S. forces aren't directly involved in fighting aside from sending military materiel, humanitarian aid and money. The U.S. government discourages Americans from fighting in Ukraine, which raises legal and national security issues. Russia’s invasion has given Ukraine's embassy in Washington the task of fielding inquiries from thousands of Americans who want to help in the fight, and Ukraine is using the internet to recruit volunteers for a foreign force, the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine. “Anyone who wants to join the defense of security in Europe and the world can come and stand side by side with the Ukrainians against the invaders of the 21st century,” President President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a recruitment pitch. Texan Anja Osmon, who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan while serving in the U.S. Army from 2009 through 2015, said she went to Ukraine on her own. A medic, she said she arrived in Ukraine on March 20 and lived in the woods with other members of the International Legion before a new commander sent her away because he didn’t want female fighters. Osmon, 30, said her mother wants her home before September. But for now she’s anxious to get out of the hotel where she is staying in Lviv and catch on with another fighting force nearer the action. “I can’t turn away from injustice,” she said. “No one should be scared.” U.S. Marine veteran Eddy Etue said he quit his job in the gig economy, found a friend in Colorado to watch his cat and gave up his home four blocks from the beach in San Diego, California, to help out in Ukraine, where he's been about two weeks. He first worked with an aid organization but now is training with the International Legion. Etue, 36, said he simply couldn't stay home. “It's just the right thing to do,” said Etue, who financed the journey through an online fundraising campaign. Etue's family history pulled him toward Ukraine. He said his grandparents left Hungary with nothing but their four children and clothes after the 1956 revolution, which was put down by Soviet forces that killed or wounded thousands. “What’s happening here will affect not only the people who are experiencing it but their children and grandchildren as well,"" he said. ""I know that from personal experience.” Jozefowicz, the former Chicago cop, says there are thousands of American and other volunteers in Ukraine. Multiple organizations are operating in the country, and Jozefowicz said his group alone has placed scores of volunteers in positions all over the country, with about 40 of those being combat jobs. “We do not facilitate a civilian going into any direct-action role. We only guide and connect prior military volunteers,” he said. But there's plenty of other work to do. Groups of volunteers are getting medical and food supplies to people in the nation of 44 million people, he said, and others are working with refugees and others who've had to flee their homes. “The closer I got into Ukraine and the more time I spent in Ukraine, the more voids I found that needed to be filled to maximize my groups volunteer efforts,” he said. Osmon, who said she's been in contact with Jozefowicz's group, said she supplied troops with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications after days in the woods. “Most everyone had air raid fever from hiding in the trenches in the snow and cold air,” she said. “Bronchitis was ravaging us.” Etue said he got a feel for the country after making a 24-hour round trip with another volunteer to pick up a vehicle in Odessa. He said he's been impressed with the quality of people serving in the International Legion since Ukrainians have done a good job of weeding out the inexperienced and “war tourists” who don't have much to offer a military unit. “I think they’re doing amazingly well given that they’re at war with one of the largest standing armies in the world,” he said.",6
"Poland is calling on its European Union partners to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia’s oil and natural gas sectors over the war in Ukraine On Location: May 2, 2022 BRUSSELS -- Poland urged its European Union partners on Monday to unite and impose sweeping sanctions on Russia's oil and natural gas sectors over the war in Ukraine, and not to cave in to pressure to pay for their gas in Russian rubles. EU ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss their response to Russia’s decision last week to cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland. Energy giant Gazprom says the two countries failed to pay their bills in April. “We will call for immediate sanctions on Russian oil and gas. This is the next, and urgent, and absolute step,"" Polish Climate and Environment Minister Anna Moskwa said. “We already have coal. Now it’s time for oil, and (the) second step is for gas. The best option is take them all together.” In a move last week branded in Europe as “blackmail,” Russian energy giant Gazprom cut supplies to Bulgaria and Poland. It came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that “unfriendly” countries must start paying for gas in rubles, Russia’s currency. Bulgaria and Poland have refused to do so, like most EU countries. More Gazprom bills are due on May 20, and the bloc is wary that Russia might turn off more taps then. Russia rejects the claims of blackmail. The 27 nation EU imports around 40% of the gas it consumes from Russia. But some member countries, notably Hungary and Slovakia, are more heavily dependent on Russian supplies than others, and support for a gradual phasing in of an oil embargo is emerging. Germany believes it could cope if supplies of Russian oil were cut off by Moscow. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said that Russian oil now accounts for 12% of total imports, down from 35% before the war, and most of it goes to the Schwedt refinery near Berlin. “Germany is not against an oil ban from Russia. Of course it is a heavy load to bear, but we are ready to do that,"" Habeck told reporters. He said that a few more weeks or months to find oil transporting ships, and to better prepare harbors and pipelines would be useful. “Time is helpful but I think other countries have bigger problems, and as I have asked for solidarity or understanding of the German situation, I am also of course willing to understand the maybe more difficult situation for other countries,"" he said. The bulk of Monday's meeting is focused on shoring up gas supplies and not giving in to Putin's demand that companies pay for gas in rubles. Around 97% of European contracts have been concluded in euros or dollars. The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, has warned that companies ceding to pressure to convert euros to rubles through two accounts at Gazprombank would be in contravention of the bloc’s sanctions. “We shouldn’t support Gazprombank, we shouldn’t support the Russian economy. We are not obliged to follow Putin’s decree, to follow Putin’s law. We’ve got European law. We’ve got national law,” Moskwa said. She added that Poland's gas supplies are not at risk. The EU has hit Russian officials, oligarchs, banks, companies and other organizations with rafts of sanctions since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February. The commission is working on a sixth round of measures, possibly including oil restrictions, and could announce them this week. The measures would have to be approved by the member countries, which could take several days. Despite the pressure, Europe does have some leverage in the dispute since it pays Russia $400 million a day for gas, a huge dent in Moscow's coffers should it opt for a complete cutoff. Off the Dutch North Sea coast, meanwhile, a fuel tanker stood idle at anchor after port workers in Amsterdam said they would not unload its cargo of Russian diesel. The Marshall Islands-flagged Sunny Liger was initially scheduled to unload in Sweden, but dockers there refused to carry out the work. Dutch port employees with the FNV dockers’ union say they also refused to unload the tanker out of solidarity with their Swedish colleagues. Union spokeswoman Asmae Hajjari told NOS Radio 1 over the weekend that “the ship is not welcome.” ——— Frank Jordans in Berlin and Mike Corder in The Hague contributed to this report. ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",9
"COVID-19 rules for travelers will vary depending on the destination How pandemic drastically changed career paths for women What happens if I get COVID-19 while traveling? Depending on your destination, it could result in an unexpected change in plans, such as being required to stay isolated in a hotel. It's why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you have backup plans ready if you're traveling abroad. You might have to stay longer than planned if you test positive. In some places, you won't be able to board flights until you test negative. In others, you might also be required to stay in a quarantine facility. Since results from a PCR test can remain positive for weeks after an infection, those who have had COVID-19 might have to get documentation from a doctor or health authorities saying they've recovered. Some travel only requires an antigen test. If you end up needing medical treatment, check with your embassy for suggested health care providers. Keep in mind that some countries still have overwhelmed health care systems due to the pandemic. Plan time for recovery since some countries — including the U.S. — require a negative test for reentry. Exceptions to this policy may be granted on an “extremely limited” basis, such as in the event of an emergency medical evacuation or humanitarian crisis, says the CDC. It also helps to be financially prepared to pay unexpected bills. While it varies country to country, travelers are often responsible for costs associated with any isolation or medical treatments needed. Travel companies suggest getting insurance that will cover the cost of treatment, isolation or rescheduled travel plans. Some countries require that you have insurance before you’re allowed to enter. ——— The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in this series. Submit them at: FactCheck@AP.org.

"Among the scathing findings of an investigation launched after the police killing of George Floyd is that the Minneapolis Police Department used covert or fake social media accounts to monitor Black activists and organizations On Location: May 2, 2022 ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Among the scathing findings of an investigation launched after the police killing of George Floyd is that Minneapolis police used covert or bogus social media accounts to monitor Black individuals and groups despite having no clear public safety rationale for doing so. The report released Wednesday by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights echoes numerous past revelations that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have — sometimes illegally — secretly surveilled prominent people and communities of color even though they weren't involved in any criminal activity. Overall, the two-year investigation found that the Minneapolis Police Department engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade, including stopping and arresting Black people at a higher rate than white people, more frequent use of force on people of color and a department culture that tolerated racist language. Regarding social media, it spotlighted departmental abuses turned up in a review spanning activity between 2010 and 2020. Officers used “covert, or fake” accounts to seek and gain access to the online profiles of Black individuals including an unnamed City Council member and a state elected official, the report said, as well as groups such as the Minneapolis NAACP and Urban League. The activity included friend requests, comments on posts, private messages and participation in discussions. “When doing so, officers posed as like-minded individuals and claimed, for example, that they met the targeted person at a prior demonstration or protest,” the report said. The report acknowledged that law enforcement can have legitimate reasons for tracking social media “if a clear investigative purpose to advance public safety exists,” and if clear procedures and accountability mechanisms are in place. But Minneapolis police fell well short of those standards, investigators determined, improperly using the accounts “to surveil and engage Black individuals, Black organizations, and elected officials unrelated to criminal activity, without a public safety objective.” The report doesn’t include enough details to support criminal charges against any specific officers or lawsuits by individuals who were targeted, but some observers say it seems likely the Human Rights Department has other information from the investigation that a lawyer could use to try to build a case. Spokesman Taylor Putz said the agency was unable to release any information beyond what's in the report because the case is still considered open while it works with the city to address the problems it identified. Minneapolis police spokesman Howie Padilla said his department was still digesting the document and declined further comment. Via Twitter, the Minneapolis NAACP expressed dismay over having spent years working with police to try to address problems “only for MPD to continue to stall efforts and turn around and surveil us.” Andrew Ferguson, a law professor and expert on police technology and surveillance at American University, said that of the many examples of misconduct outlined in the report, “the abuse of social media raises a red flag for all police departments.” “What is happening in Minnesota is happening in many jurisdictions, because there are few rules in place and no accountability,” Ferguson said. “Police rummage through social media without limits, turning our digital lives into sources of surveillance. It might feel less violent than some of the other police misconduct, but it is still violative and wrong.” For Diala Shamas, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, the revelations are echoes of a covert FBI program from the 1950s to early ’70s, known as Cointelpro, that illegally conducted surveillance and sabotage against civil rights groups and other organizations, sowing paranoia, distrust and violence. Targets included the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the Black Panthers, Malcolm X and many others. The police actions in Minneapolis, Shamas said, amount to “Cointelpro tactics with a modern twist.” Law enforcement agencies across the country have been using social media surveillance for years, however. A 2016 survey by the Urban Institute and the International Association of Chiefs of Police found that 70% of departments mined social networks during investigations. But the rules governing how they do so are often opaque, vague or not a matter of public record. In an ongoing study of police policies in U.S. jurisdictions with at least 100,000 people, researchers at the Brennan Center for Justice found just 35 police departments had publicly available policies that in some way addressed the use of social media for collecting information. Of those, 15 had language setting some limits on undercover or covert online activity. But several were vague or set a low bar for authorization, simply requiring supervisor approval. “I would say that very few if any of the policies really gave detailed, robust limitations on the use of undercover accounts,” said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, deputy director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. Police misuse of social media has been uncovered in departments beyond Minneapolis, she noted. In Tennessee, a lawsuit by the state chapter of the ACLU exposed the use of covert Facebook accounts by Memphis officers to target activists of color and community justice advocates. A federal judge determined that violated a longstanding consent decree barring the department from infringing on activities protected by the First Amendment. And in California, the Brennan Center obtained records showing that third-party social media monitoring companies had pitched their services to the Los Angeles Police Department, including the ability to create furtive accounts for officers. While the city requires approval for some undercover online activity, Levinson-Waldman said, there are exceptions such as for threat assessments that allow officers to sidestep real oversight or accountability. Facebook and its parent company warned both departments they had violated terms of service, she added. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter all have policies prohibiting the use of their data for surveillance, and Facebook’s guidelines for law enforcement specifically prohibit fake accounts. Shamas, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said covert surveillance like that practiced in Minneapolis and elsewhere can have serious and chilling effects. “The idea that you don’t know that the person you’re liaising with is undercover or an informant means you’re going to be less likely to explore new ideas for strategies and campaigns,” she said, “all the things that are important for a democratic society.” ——— This story was first published on April 28. It was updated on May 2 to correct that the Brennan Center hasn't finished studying the police department policies in all U.S. jurisdictions with at least 100,000 people. ——— Associated Press reporters Doug Glass in Minneapolis and Stephen Groves in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, contributed to this report.",3
"A top-level U.S. congressional delegation led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has visited Warsaw to express gratitude to Poles for their humanitarian and other support for Ukraine On Location: May 2, 2022 WARSAW, Poland -- A top-level U.S. congressional delegation led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in Warsaw on Monday to express gratitude to Poland for their humanitarian and other support for Ukraine. Pelosi and a half dozen U.S. lawmakers met with President Andrzej Duda and Polish lawmakers in Warsaw. The visit followed a weekend visit to Kyiv where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pledging to support his country until it defeats Russia. In a statement after the meeting with Duda, Pelosi called him “a valued partner in supporting the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s brutal and unprovoked war.” She said that during their meeting the members of her delegation “expressed America’s deep gratitude to the Polish government and Polish people for opening their hearts and homes to Ukrainian refugees, and we reaffirmed our nation’s pledge to continue supporting Poland’s humanitarian efforts.” Russians invasion of Ukraine has sparked a refugee crisis, with more than 5.5 million people fleeing the country. The largest group by far — more than 3 million people — have arrived in Poland, and many of them have remained. Regular Polish people have taken Ukrainians into their homes, while the government and volunteers have mobilized to help in countless ways. The trip came two days after U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress for $33 billion to bolster Ukraine’s fight against Russia, more than twice the size of the initial $13.6 billion aid measure that now is almost drained. The measure is designed to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that U.S. weaponry and other forms of assistance aren’t going away. During a news conference on Sunday in Rzeszow, Poland, the members of the congressional delegation were unanimous in praising Ukraine’s defenses, in painting the battle of one as good against evil and in assuring continued long-term U.S. military, humanitarian and economic support. ——— More AP coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",6
"Ukrainian fighters say Russian forces began storming a sprawling steel plant in the besieged port city of Mariupol on Tuesday ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine -- Russian forces Tuesday began storming the steel mill containing the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol, Ukrainian defenders said, just as scores of civilians evacuated from the bombed-out plant over the weekend reached relative safety in Ukrainian-held territory. Osnat Lubrani, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said that thanks to the evacuation effort, “101 women, men, children and older persons could finally leave the bunkers below the Azovstal steelworks and see the daylight after two months.” One evacuee said she went to sleep there every night afraid she wouldn't wake up. “You can’t imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking,” Yelena Tsybulchenko said upon arriving in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles (230 kilometers) northwest of Mariupol, in a convoy of buses and ambulances. She added: ""We were praying to God that missiles fly over our shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all of us would be done.” The news for those left behind was more grim. Ukrainian commanders said Russian forces backed by tanks and other armor began storming the sprawling plant, which includes a maze of tunnels and bunkers spread out over 11 square kilometers (4 square miles). How many Ukrainian fighters were holed up inside was unclear, but the Russians put the number at about 2,000 in recent weeks, and there were reports that 500 were wounded. A few hundred civilians also remained there, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. “We’ll do everything that’s possible to repel the assault, but we’re calling for urgent measures to evacuate the civilians that remain inside the plant and to bring them out safely,” Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of Ukraine’s Azov Regiment, said on the messaging app Telegram. He added that throughout the night, the plant was hit with naval artillery fire and airstrikes. Two civilian women were killed and 10 civilians wounded, he said. In other battlefield developments, Russian troops shelled a chemical plant in the eastern city of Avdiivka, killing at least 10 people, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. “The Russians knew exactly where to aim — the workers just finished their shift and were waiting for a bus at a bus stop to take them home,” Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post. “Another cynical crime by Russians on our land.” The assault on the Azovstal steelworks began almost two weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military not to storm the plant to finish off the defenders but to seal it off. The first — and so far only — civilians to be evacuated from the shattered plant got out during a brief cease-fire over the weekend, in an operation overseen by the U.N. and the Red Cross. At a reception center in Zaporizhzhia, stretchers and wheelchairs were lined up, tiny children’s shoes dangled from a shopping cart and a pile of toys waited for the convoy. Medical and psychological teams were on standby. The arrival of the convoy was a rare glimmer of good news in the nearly 10-week conflict that has killed thousands, forced millions to flee the country, laid waste to towns and cities, and shifted the post-Cold War balance of power in Eastern Europe. “Over the past days, traveling with the evacuees, I have heard mothers, children and frail grandparents speak about the trauma of living day after day under unrelenting heavy shelling and the fear of death, and with extreme lack of water, food and sanitation,” the U.N.'s Lubrani said. “They spoke of the hell they have experienced since this war started, seeking refuge in the Azovstal plant."" Lubrani said many of the evacuees had run to the steel plant for safety and got trapped. In addition to the 101 people evacuated from the steelworks, 58 joined the convoy in a town on the outskirts of Mariupol, Lubrani said. Some decided not to travel all the way to Zaporizhzhia, where a total of 127 arrived Tuesday, she said. The Russian military said earlier that some of the evacuees chose to stay in separatist areas. About a dozen people taken out in the convoy were sick or injured, but none was in critical condition, according to Pascal Hundt, head of the Ukraine office of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Tsybulchenko rejected Russian allegations that the Ukrainian fighters wouldn't allow civilians to leave the plant. She said the military told civilians ""that if you want to risk your life, you can go."" “We understood clearly that under these murder weapons, we wouldn’t survive, we wouldn’t manage to go anywhere,” she said. Mariupol has come to symbolize the human misery inflicted by the war. The Russians' two-month siege of the strategic southern port has trapped civilians with little or no food, water, medicine or heat, as Moscow’s forces pounded the city into rubble. The plant in particular has transfixed the outside world. The pummeling of the steelworks resumed after the weekend evacuation. Vadim Astafyev, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, said Ukrainian fighters used the cease-fire to come out from underground and take up new firing positions at the plant. Russian troops along with Moscow-backed separatist forces used artillery and aircraft ""to destroy these firing positions,” he said. After failing to take Kyiv in the early weeks of the war, Russia withdrew from around the capital and announced that its chief objective was the capture of Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, known as the Donbas. Mariupol lies in the region, and its fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for fighting elsewhere in the Donbas. But so far, Russia’s troops and their allied separatist forces appear to have made only minor gains in the eastern offensive, taking several small towns as they try to advance in relatively small groups against staunch Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine's resistance has been significantly bolstered by Western arms, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a 300 million pounds ($375 million) in new military aid, including radar, drones and armored vehicles. In a speech delivered remotely to Ukraine’s parliament, he pronounced Ukraine's battle to hold off the Russians the country's “finest hour,” echoing the words of Winston Churchill during World War II. “Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free,” he said. ——— Associated Press journalists Inna Varenytsia and David Keyton in Kyiv, Jon Gambrell and Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Mstyslav Chernov in Kharkiv, and AP staff around the world contributed to this report. ——— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",3
"Russian forces pounded targets across Ukraine, taking aim at supply lines for foreign weapons in the west and intensifying an offensive in the east LVIV, Ukraine -- Complaining that the West is ""stuffing Ukraine with weapons,” Russia pounded railroad stations and other supply-line points across the country, as the European Union moved to further punish Moscow for the war Wednesday by proposing a ban on oil imports, a crucial source of revenue. Heavy fighting also raged at the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol that represented the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the ruined southern port city, according to the mayor. But a Russian official denied Moscow's troops were storming the plant, as Ukrainian commanders claimed a day earlier. The Russian military said Wednesday it used sea- and air-launched missiles to destroy electric power facilities at five railway stations across Ukraine, while artillery and aircraft also struck troop strongholds and fuel and ammunition depots. The flurry of attacks comes as Russia prepares to celebrate Victory Day on May 9, marking the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany. The world is watching for whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will use the occasion to declare a victory or expand what he calls a “special military operation.” A declaration of all-out war would allow Putin to introduce martial law and mobilize reservists to make up for significant troop losses. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the speculation as “nonsense.” As areas across Ukraine came under renewed attack, Belarus, which Russia used as a staging ground for its invasion, announced military exercises starting Wednesday. A top Ukrainian official said the country will be ready to act if Belarus joins the fighting. The attacks on rail infrastructure were meant to disrupt the delivery of Western weapons, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the West is “stuffing Ukraine with weapons.” Western weaponry pouring into Ukraine helped its forces thwart Russia’s initial drive to seize Kyiv and seems certain to play a central role in the growing battle for the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that Moscow now says is its main objective. Ukraine has urged the West to ramp up the supply of weapons ahead of that potentially decisive clash. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, which had been slow at first to help arm Ukraine, said his government is considering supplying howitzers, in addition to Gepard anti-aircraft guns and other equipment it has agreed to send. The governor of the eastern Donetsk region, which lies in the Donbas, said Russian attacks left 21 people dead on Tuesday, the highest number of known fatalities since April 8, when a missile attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk killed at least 59. In addition to supplying weapons to Ukraine, Europe and the U.S. have sought to punish Moscow with sanctions. The EU's top official called on the 27-nation bloc on Wednesday to ban Russian oil imports. “We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, in a way that allows us and our partners to secure alternative supply routes and minimizes the impact on global markets,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. The proposals need unanimous approval from EU countries and are likely to be the subject of fierce debate. Hungary and Slovakia have already said they won't take part in any oil sanctions. They could be granted an exemption. The EU has also started talking about a possible embargo on Russian natural gas. The bloc has already approved a cut-off of Russian coal. Russia’s economy, including funding for its military, is heavily dependent on oil and natural gas exports. Von der Leyen also proposed that Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, and two other major banks be disconnected from the SWIFT international banking payment system. On Tuesday, in one of the most crucial battles of the war, Ukrainian fighters said Russian forces began storming the bombed-out steel mill in Mariupol. But the Kremlin said that was not true. “There is no assault. We see that there are cases of escalation due to the fact that the militants take up the firing positions. These attempts are being suppressed very quickly,” Peskov said. Over the weekend, more than 100 people — including women, the elderly and 17 children — were evacuated from the plant during a cease-fire in an operation overseen by the U.N. and the Red Cross. But the attacks on the plant soon resumed, and no further evacuations were organized. It was unclear how many Ukrainian fighters were still inside, but the Russians put the number at about 2,000 in recent weeks, and 500 were reported to be wounded. A few hundred civilians also remained there, the Ukrainian side said. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said that Russian forces were targeting the plant with heavy artillery, tanks, aircraft, warships and “heavy bombs that pierce concrete 3 to 5 meters thick.” “Our brave guys are defending this fortress, but it is very difficult,” he said. His claims could not be independently verified, and he said he had lost contact with the fighters at Azovstal. “Unfortunately, today the connection with the guys in order to understand what is happening there, whether they are safe or not, disappeared,” Boychenko said. Mariupol, and the plant in particular, have come to symbolize the misery inflicted by the war. The Russians have pulverized most of the city in a two-month siege that has trapped civilians with little or no food, water, medicine or heat. The city's fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas. ——— This story has been updated to correct that von der Leyen was speaking Strasbourg, not Brussels. ——— Anna reported from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.

"The European Union’s leader has called on the 27-nation bloc to ban oil imports from Russia in a sixth package of sanctions targeting Moscow for its war in Ukraine On Location: May 4, 2022 BRUSSELS -- The European Union's top official on Wednesday called on the 27-nation bloc to ban oil imports from Russia and target the country’s biggest bank and major broadcasters in a sixth package of sanctions against Moscow for its war in Ukraine. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, proposed to EU's member nations to phase out imports of crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of the year. “We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, in a way that allows us and our partners to secure alternative supply routes and minimizes the impact on global markets,” von der Leyen said. The proposals need to be unanimously approved to take effect and are likely to be the subject of fierce debate. Von der Leyen conceded that getting all 27 member countries — some of them landlocked and highly dependent on Russia for energy supplies — to agree on oil sanctions “will not be easy.” The EU gets about 25% of its oil from Russia, most of which goes toward gasoline and diesel for vehicles. Russia supplies about 14% of diesel, S&P Global analysts said, and a cutoff could send already high prices for truck and tractor fuel towering. If approved, the ban on oil imports will be the second package of EU sanctions targeting Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine that President Vladimir Putin started on Feb. 24. In addition to sanctions on various entities and individuals — including Putin himself and members of his family — the bloc previously approved an embargo on coal imports. The EU has started discussions on a possible natural gas embargo, but consensus among member countries on targeting the fuel used to generate electricity and heat homes is more difficult to secure. The region gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia. In a sign of the political pressure that von der Leyen has been under to widen EU sanctions on Russia energy, some European Parliament members on Wednesday stepped up calls for the bloc to target imports of natural gas from Russia as well. “That’s great news that we are moving on the oil embargo,” Luis Garicano, a Spanish member of the EU assembly, said after von der Leyen’s announcement. “But as you know this is far short of what this parliament wants. We actually asked a month ago for a full embargo on gas and oil.” Hungary and Slovakia have already said they wouldn't take part in any oil sanctions, but von der Leyen didn't elaborate on whether they would receive an exemption from the sanctions, although this appears likely. Von der Leyen also said that the EU should target high-ranking military officers and others “who committed war crimes in Bucha,” a suburb of the capital Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have alleged that retreating Russian troops carried out mass killings of civilians in Bucha. “This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin’s war: We know who you are. We will hold you accountable. You’re not getting away with this,” von der Leyen told the lawmakers. Von der Leyen said that Putin’s intention is “to wipe out Ukraine from the map,” but predicted he will fail in his deadly enterprise. “On the contrary, Ukraine has risen in bravery and in unity,"" she said. “And it is his own country, Russia, that Putin is sinking.” Banks are also in the EU executive arm’s sights, and notably Sberbank. Von der Leyen said the aim is that “we de-SWIFT Sberbank."" SWIFT is the major global system for financial transfers. Von der Leyen said Sberbank holds around 37% of the Russian banking sector. “And we will also de-SWIFT two other major banks in Russia. By that, we hit banks that are systemically critical to the Russian financial system and Putin’s ability to wage destruction,"" she said. Von der Leyen added that those alleged to be spreading disinformation about the war in Ukraine would be targeted. “We are banning three big Russian state-owned broadcasters from our airwaves. They will not be allowed to distribute their content anymore in the EU, in whatever shape or form be it on cable, via satellite, on the internet or via smartphone apps.” She didn't name the broadcasters directly, but branded the television channels “as mouthpieces that amplify Putin´s lies and propaganda aggressively. We should not give them a stage anymore to spread these lies.” ——— Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2
"The projected increases come after weeks of steady upticks in infections. NYC raises COVID-19 risk alert level For the first time in months, daily hospital admission levels and new COVID-19 related deaths in the United States are both projected to increase over the next four weeks, according to updated forecast models used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The projected increases come after weeks of steady upticks in infections across the country, subsequent to the removal of masking requirements and mitigation measures in many states and cities. The forecast now predicts that approximately 5,000 deaths will occur over the next two weeks, with Ohio, New York, and New Jersey projected to see the largest totals of daily deaths in the weeks to come. “We are still in the middle of a pandemic, to be sure—there’s no confusion about that,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told Foreign Policy last week. The forecast models show that 42 states and territories in hospital admissions across the country, including New York, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida, are projected to see increases in the next two weeks. Nationally, a growing number of COVID-19 positive patients have already been admitted to hospitals, requiring care, federal data shows. Since late last month, daily hospital admission totals have been slowly increasing, particularly in the Northeast, according to CDC data. And in the last week, admissions have jumped by 20%, with emergency department visits also up by 18%. On average, more than 2,200 virus-positive Americans are entering the hospital each day -- a total that has increased by 20% in the last week, the CDC reports. This also marks the highest number of patients requiring care since mid-March. Overall, there are about 18,300 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in hospitals across the country, up by 18% in the last two weeks, the Department of Health and Human Services reports. Although totals remain significantly lower than during other parts of the pandemic, admission levels are now on the rise in every region of the country. Nationally, new infection rates have reached their highest point in nearly two months. More than 60,000 new cases are being officially reported each day, up by 27% in the last week, according to the CDC. In the Northeast and New York-New Jersey region, infection rates have risen by 64.8% and 54.8% respectively, over the last two weeks. Since last summer, dozens of states have moved to shutter public testing sites, with more at-home COVID-19 tests now available. Most Americans are not reporting their results to officials, and thus, experts say infection totals are likely significantly undercounted. Health experts say a confluence of factors is likely driving the nation’s latest viral resurgence, including the easing of masking requirements and other COVID-19 restrictions as well as highly contagious omicron subvariants, which have been estimated to be between 30% and 80% more transmissible than the original omicron strain. The BA.2 subvariant, BA.2.12.1, first discovered domestically last month, in New York state, continues to steadily increase in the U.S., newly released federal data shows. The subvariant now accounts for 36.5% of new COVID-19 cases nationwide, while in the New York — New Jersey area, it accounts for the majority — nearly 62% — of new cases. With vaccine immunity waning and the presence of variants of concern growing, health officials continue to urge the public to get vaccinated and boosted to prevent the risk of severe disease and hospitalization. “We hope that we don’t see a major uptick [in cases] as we get into the fall, but that remains to be seen. We’re going to have to wait and see, which is the reason why we’re still encouraging people to get vaccinated,” Fauci said last week. “If you’ve not been vaccinated or if you have been vaccinated and are eligible for a booster, make sure to get it now.”",6
"The invasion of Ukraine means fewer Russian tanks and other military hardware will rumble through Red Square on Monday, when the country marks its victory in World War II On Location: May 4, 2022 The invasion of Ukraine means that fewer Russian tanks and other military hardware will rumble through Moscow’s Red Square on Monday, when the country marks its victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The patriotic fervor associated with the sacred holiday, however, could be as strong as ever. This year's Victory Day won't just honor a conflict that ended 77 years ago. Many Russians will be thinking about the thousands of troops fighting in neighboring Ukraine, Signs of support for the military have grown across the country since the invasion began Feb. 24, with the letter “Z” appearing on billboards and signs in the streets and subways, and on television and social media. The Kremlin has refused to refer to the fighting in Ukraine as a “war,” instead calling it a “special military operation.” Some observers believe that President Vladimir Putin could use the holiday to finally declare the operation to be a war in order to bolster Russia's national commitment to the effort. A look at the significance of Victory Day in Russia: WAR AND REMEMBRANCE The Soviet Union lost a staggering 27 million people in World War II, which it calls the Great Patriotic War. The conflict, which devastated cities and the countryside, caused enormous suffering and left a deep scar in the national psyche. Victory Day is a rare event in the nation’s divisive post-Soviet history that is revered by all political players, and the Kremlin has used that sentiment to encourage patriotic pride and underline Russia’s role as a global power. The annual celebrations feature a massive military parade on Red Square showcasing the latest armaments from tanks to fighter jets to nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles. This year, the array of weapons to be displayed in the parade has been significantly curtailed from last year in an apparent reflection of the military's heavy engagement in Ukraine. FIGHTING ‘NEO-NAZIS’ In ordering the invasion, Putin declared that it was aimed at the “demilitarization” of Ukraine to remove a perceived military threat to Russia by ""neo-Nazis” — rhetoric condemned by Ukraine and the West as a fictitious cover for a blunt act of aggression. To try to back up the claim, Putin and his officials have pointed to the adulation by Ukraine's right-wing groups of nationalist leaders Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych, who sided with the Nazis during World War II and their perceived use of Nazi units' symbols. The rhetoric also has been used by the Kremlin to try to bolster public support for the war amid heavy losses of troops and equipment and massive economic damage from Western sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, has derided the Kremlin “denazification” claim. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov fired back by drawing a parallel between Zelenskyy and Adolf Hitler — a statement that has drawn sharp criticism from Israel. RUSHING THE OFFENSIVE? Some in Ukraine and the West expected Putin to try to seek quick gains before the May 9 holiday in a possible attempt to present it as a decisive victory and use it as an exit from what increasingly looks like a disastrous quagmire bleeding Russia's resources and threatening its stability. After a failed attempt to storm Kyiv and other big cities in Ukraine's north in the early stages of the war, the Kremlin has shifted its focus to the eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas, where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014. That conflict erupted weeks after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The Russian military has rearmed and resupplied its forces withdrawn from Kyiv and moved them to Donbas in an apparent attempt to encircle and destroy the most capable and seasoned Ukrainian troops concentrated there. But that offensive in the east has faced staunch Ukrainian defenses and made only incremental advances, dashing Kremlin hopes for a quick victory. Significant gains look all but impossible before May 9. In an interview this week, Lavrov said: “Our military isn't going to artificially link its action to any date, including Victory Day.” UPPING THE ANTE Some Russian hard-liners have criticized the Kremlin for using only a limited force and urged a nationwide mobilization effort. Some Western officials and observers believe Putin may use May 9 to formally declare a war and announce a total mobilization of the population to boost troop numbers for an offensive. “He’s been rolling the pitch, laying the ground for being able to say, ‘Look, this is now a war against Nazis, and what I need is more people,’"" British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told LBC Radio last week. Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, issued a similar warning Monday, alleging that Russia has covertly begun preparations for a broad mobilization. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claims as “nonsense” on Wednesday. Russian authorities have claimed that only volunteer contract soldiers have been fighting in Ukraine, even though many conscripts were taken prisoner in the war's initial days. Russia's military has about 1 million service personnel — 400,000 of them contract soldiers, including 147,000 in ground forces. Western officials estimated the initial strength of Russia's invasion force at about 180,000. The military acknowledged losing 1,351 soldiers as of March 25 and hasn't updated its casualty numbers since then. Western officials have said Russian losses were much heavier and estimated that up to a quarter of Moscow's initial attacking force was made unfit for combat. If the war drags on, the current Russian troops numbers in Ukraine could be insufficient to sustain the operations, forcing the Kremlin to rely on poorly trained conscripts or call up reservists. The Kremlin faces a stark choice between trying to win the war with a limited force or attempting to bolster its troops in Ukraine with draftees and reservists, a move that could bring public outrage and potentially destabilize the political situation.",6
"Pfizer executives said that they are the reports “very seriously."" Who is eligible for COVID-19 antiviral drug Paxlovid?  When Laura Martin tested positive for COVID-19  last month during an extended stay in California, she was prescribed Paxlovid, the highly touted antiviral drug created by Pfizer. Just one day after her diagnosis, she started her five-day course of pills, which have been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of hospitalization and death. Martin, a 63-year-old Boston native who now resides in Canada, said she was thrilled when her symptoms began to subside. “By the end of [the treatment], on Day 5, I was negative and feeling completely normal like without any symptoms, so I thought, 'Wow, this is really great. What a great drug,’” Martin told ABC News. Martin resumed her normal activities, but a week later, she began to feel ill again. When her symptoms worsened, she tested again. “It came roaring back, and this round two has been much more severe than round one was,"" Martin said. ""This is like four days of much more significant symptoms than round one.” ?Martin's case is part of a seemingly rare, but increasingly reported phenomenon of COVID-19 symptom recurrence after being treated with Paxlovid. While it is largely unknown what is causing the reported viral resurgence, scientists say they are investigating. ?? Pfizer says that it is taking the reported incidences of recurrence ""very seriously,"" but that the rates mirror those who received a placebo in clinical trials. Experts urge that the benefits of the drug, in preventing hospitalization and death, outweigh the potential risk of a second positive test or symptom reemergence. In additional analysis of the Paxlovid clinical trial data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that most patients “did not have symptoms at the time of a positive PCR test after testing negative, and, most importantly, there was no increased occurrence of hospitalization or death or development of drug resistance.” Company executives also reported, this week, that the use of Paxlovid continues to expand rapidly, particularly as infection rates across the country rise again. In the U.S., use of the treatment has increased by nearly ten-fold in recent weeks. The number of locations in the U.S. with Paxlovid supply has grown to more than 33,000 sites now available, a four-fold increase since late-February. In addition, the company reported that there are now more than 2,200 Test to Treat locations now open. 'Game-changer' Long heralded as a “game-changer” in the fight against COVID-19, the push to make Paxlovid available to Americans has ramped up in recent weeks, with the White House looking to increase supply of the treatment. The drug, which was granted emergency use authorization by the FDA in December 2021 for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 at high risk of disease progression, is also strongly recommended by the World Health Organization. It has been shown to be highly effective, estimated to provide an 89% reduction in virus-related hospitalizations and deaths. However, in recent weeks, a number of patients, who have taken the treatment, have taken to social media to disclose what they say is a perplexing phenomenon of COVID-19 symptoms reemerging after they finished the prescribed five-day treatment course. Some individuals claimed on Twitter that after their initial symptoms dissipated, leading to a negative test, they are once again testing positive. “We're seeing people get better on Paxlovid,” Dr. Shira Doron, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, told ABC News. “But then, when they stop at the end of five days, we're hearing stories of symptoms coming back and even, tests becoming either more positive, i.e. a darker line, or tests that had gone negative turning positive.” Studies have found that a dark line can “indicates a strong positive with a high level of virus and is usually seen when people are at or near peak virus load.” Reports of these “rebound symptoms” are largely anecdotal so far but with an increasing number of questions about the puzzling viral recurrence, scientists across the country are trying to assess what may be happening in new research. Pfizer taking reports of viral rebounds ‘very seriously’ In February, a 71-year-old man in Massachusetts who had been vaccinated and boosted recovered after being treated for COVID-19 with Paxlovid, Dr. Michael Charness, chief of staff at the VA Boston Healthcare System, who has been researching the phenomenon and recently put out a preprint study last week, told ABC News. However, around nine days after his initial positive test, Charness said his patient developed cold symptoms and tested positive again for the virus. Molecular testing soon revealed that the patient’s viral load had increased to an even higher point than when the diagnosis was first made, according to an analysis by Charness and his team. “We were interested in whether this was a new infection or whether this was maybe an adaptation or mutation that somehow changed the variant,” Charness said, adding that gene sequencing demonstrated that this second positive test demonstrated a recurrence of the original infection in an individual who had no symptoms for a week. “We just were very struck by that,” said Charness. “I heard from people all over the country and some from other parts of the world, who had had the same experience.” Representatives from the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, told ABC News that teams of scientists are investigating the surprising relapse reports, and they will provide further recommendations, if appropriate. “The phenomenon of recrudescence reiterates the importance of following CDC’s isolation guidance – anyone who develops symptoms of illness during or after isolation should remain isolated, masked, and seek out testing and clinical care,” a representative from the CDC told ABC News in a statement. “Anyone who is concerned about having been exposed or who for any other reason wants to determine their infection status should test for COVID-19.” The FDA stressed that the reports “do not change the conclusions from the Paxlovid clinical trial which demonstrated a marked reduction in hospitalization and death.” The viral recurrence had been observed and reported in Pfizer’s application to the FDA, last year, in which the company said several trial participants had appeared to “have a rebound” of COVID-19 around day 10 or day 14. Pfizer executives said Tuesday that they are taking the reports “very seriously,” but they do not believe that it is related to the drug, given that the same rate of rebound was observed in people who took the placebo. Further, no connection was noted between the viral load increase and subsequent severe illness. “We've taken a preliminary look at our high-risk data, and so we've seen for example, that we have about an incidence about 2% of that viral load rebound, but we also see the same, or close to the same, percent in the placebo arm. So it's something that's not particularly associated with Paxlovid itself, but may have something to do with the virus itself,” Dr. William Pao, Pfizer’s executive vice president and chief development officer said during an investors call on Tuesday. “It's preliminary data so far, we again take it very seriously. But it's very current, and a very low incidence, and we continue to learn as we go.” A representative from Pfizer told ABC News that although it is too early to determine the cause, initial indications suggest an increased viral load is both uncommon and not uniquely associated with the Paxlovid treatment. “We remain very confident in its clinical effectiveness at preventing severe outcomes from COVID-19 in high-risk patients,” the representative said. Reports uncommon but happening ‘frequently enough’ Although official reports of these relapses still appear to be rare, such occurrences are happening “frequently enough” in those treated with Paxlovid that Charness said that it should be studied further. “I think the first step in studying something is to know that it exists,” he explained, adding that it is particularly important for clinicians to be informed about potential rebounds, and for the public to know, so that people do not become unduly alarmed. Thus far, researchers know very little about the reason for the recurring symptoms. Of critical importance in the investigations is whether an individual, in the midst of such a rebound, remains infectious, Charness said. “We are sufficiently concerned about whether people can transmit, when they're on day 12 and 13 and 15, that we are essentially recommending that when people have a recurrence, a rebound, that they restart their isolation, and isolate until their antigen test is negative,” Charness said. “We're seeing people whose antigen test stays positive for a week after they rebound, which means that they're well outside the CDC’s 10-day guidance. Should you experience a viral rebound, the FDA is now recommending that health care providers and patients refer to CDC guidance, wear a mask and isolate if they have any COVID-19 symptoms — regardless of whether or not they have been treated with an antiviral. Charness and his team are also encouraging their patients to start their isolation period over again and stay away until their antigen test is negative. “It's important to exercise caution until you clear the virus the second time,” Charness said, further urging people to notify their provider. In terms of further treatments, Charness noted it is still largely unclear what patients should do. While there are no limitations, within the authorized label, around additional usage of the drug for a subsequent COVID-19 infection, according to Pfizer, the FDA said “there is no evidence of benefit at this time for a longer course of treatment … or repeating a treatment course of Paxlovid in patients with recurrent COVID-19 symptoms following completion of a treatment course.” Despite the reports of rebounding, health experts stress that Paxlovid is still largely achieving its original goal, to keep people out of the hospital, and severe disease at-bay. “The bottom line is if it prevents hospitalization, if it keeps you from progressing to severe disease, hospitalization and death, the fact that you might have a recurrence of some of the symptoms and even the recurrence of a positive test is sort of secondary,” said Doron. “The main thing is Paxlovid is to prevent progression to severe disease [and] hospitalization, and it does. So, it's still doing its job.”",3
"Ukrainian fighters at Mariupol’s pulverized steel plant are holding out against Russian troops in an increasingly desperate effort to keep Moscow from taking the strategic port city LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian fighters in the tunnels underneath Mariupol’s pulverized steel plant held out against Russian troops Thursday in an increasingly desperate and perhaps doomed effort to deny Moscow what would be its biggest success of the war yet: the complete capture of the strategic port city. The bloody battle came amid growing speculation that President Vladimir Putin wants to present the Russian people with a battlefield triumph — or announce an escalation of the war — in time for Victory Day on Monday. Victory Day is the biggest patriotic holiday on the Russian calendar, marking the Soviet Union’s triumph over Nazi Germany. Some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters, by Russia's most recent estimate, were holed up at Mariupol's sprawling Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket of resistance in a city largely reduced to rubble over the past two months. A few hundred civilians were also believed trapped there. The defenders will “stand till the end. They only hope for a miracle,"" Kateryna Prokopenko said after speaking by phone to her husband, a leader of the steel plant defenders. ""They won’t surrender.” She said her husband, Azov Regiment commander Denys Prokopenko, told her he would love her forever. “I am going mad from this. It seemed like words of goodbye,” she said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attack was preventing the evacuation of civilians remaining in the plant’s underground bunkers. “Just imagine this hell! And there are children there,” he said late Thursday in his nightly video address. “More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death.” The Russians managed to get inside with the help of an electrician who knew the layout, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Internal Affairs Ministry. “He showed them the underground tunnels which are leading to the factory,” Gerashchenko said in a video posted late Wednesday. “Yesterday, the Russians started storming these tunnels, using the information they received from the betrayer.” The Kremlin denied its troops were storming the plant. The fall of Mariupol would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that the Kremlin says is now its chief objective. Capt. Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, pleaded on Ukrainian TV for the evacuation of civilians and wounded fighters from the steelworks, saying soldiers were “dying in agony due to the lack of proper treatment.” The Kremlin has demanded the troops surrender. They have refused. Russia has also accused them of preventing the civilians from leaving. The head of the United Nations said another attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol and the plant was underway. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “We must continue to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes."" More than 100 civilians were rescued from the steelworks over the weekend. But many previous attempts to open safe corridors from Mariupol have fallen through, with Ukraine blaming shelling and firing by the Russians. Meanwhile, 10 weeks into the devastating war, Ukraine’s military claimed it recaptured some areas in the south and repelled other attacks in the east, further frustrating Putin’s ambitions after his abortive attempt to seize Kyiv. Ukrainian and Russian forces are fighting village by village. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Russian forces are making only “plodding” progress in the Donbas. The head of Britain’s armed forces, Chief of the Defense Staff Adm. Tony Radakin, said Putin is “trying to rush to a tactical victory” before Victory Day. But he said Russian forces are struggling to gain momentum. Radakin told British broadcaster Talk TV that Russia is using missiles and weapons at such a rate that it is in a “logistics war” to keep supplied. “This is going to be a hard slog,” he said. On Thursday, an American official said the U.S. shared intelligence with Ukraine about the location of a Russian flagship before the mid-April strike that sank it, one of Moscow's highest-profile failures in the war. The U.S. has provided “a range of intelligence” that includes locations of warships, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the decision to target the missile cruiser Moskva was purely a Ukrainian decision. Fearful of new attacks surrounding Victory Day, the mayor of the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk urged residents to leave for the countryside over the long weekend and warned them not to gather in public places. And the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, a key transit point for evacuees from Mariupol, announced a curfew from Sunday evening through Tuesday morning. In other developments, Belarus’ authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, defended Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in an interview with The Associated Press but said he didn’t expect the conflict to “drag on this way.” Lukashenko, whose country was used by the Russians as a launch pad for the invasion, said Moscow had to act because Kyiv was “provoking” Russia. But he also created some distance between himself and the Kremlin, repeatedly calling for an end to the conflict and referring to it as a “war” — a term Moscow refuses to use. It insists on calling the fighting a “special military operation.” Mariupol, which had a prewar population of over 400,000, has come to symbolize the misery inflicted by the war. The siege of the city has trapped perhaps 100,000 civilians with little food, water, medicine or heat. As the battle raged there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian bombardment Thursday hit dozens of Ukrainian military targets, including troop concentrations in the east, an artillery battery near the eastern settlement of Zarozhne, and rocket launchers near the southern city of Mykolaiv. Five people were killed and dozens injured in shelling of cities in the Donbas over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian officials said, with shells hitting schools, apartments and a medical facility. Ukrainian forces said they made some gains on the border of the southern regions of Kherson and Mykolaiv and repelled 11 Russian attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up the Donbas. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said that Ukrainian forces ""have largely stalled Russian advances in eastern Ukraine,” and intensified Russian airstrikes on transportation infrastructure in the western part of the country have failed to stop Western aid shipments to Ukraine. But the war has devastated the country's medical infrastructure, Zelenskyy said in a video link to a charity event in the U.K., with nearly 400 healthcare facilities damaged or destroyed. “There is simply a catastrophic situation regarding access to medical services and medicines,” in areas occupied by Russian forces, he said. ""Even the simplest drugs are lacking.” With the challenge of mine-clearing and rebuilding after the war in mind, Zelenskyy announced the launch of a global fundraising platform called United24. At the same time, Poland hosted an international donor conference that raised $6.5 billion in humanitarian aid. The gathering was attended by prime ministers and ambassadors from many European countries, as well as representatives of nations farther afield and some businesses. In addition, a Ukrainian cabinet body began to develop proposals for a comprehensive postwar reconstruction plan, while Zelenskyy also urged Western allies to put forward a program similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan plan to help Ukraine rebuild. ——— Anna reported from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.

"The move follows a similar recommendation from the CDC.  COVID-19 hospitalizations and death expected to rise The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced it's now limiting the authorized use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after conducting an updated investigation into reports of rare blood clots. Though the risk of blood clots is still extremely rare, officials said use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should be limited because there are other, safer options — including vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna — that do not carry the same risk. Use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will now be limited to people ages 18 and older for whom other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are not ""accessible or clinically appropriate,"" and to adults who choose to receive the vaccine or else they would not get vaccinated, the FDA wrote in a press release. The decision was made after conducting an updated analysis into reports of the rare blood clot condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, the FDA said. ""We recognize that the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community. Our action reflects our updated analysis of the risk of TTS following administration of this vaccine and limits the use of the vaccine to certain individuals,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, wrote in a statement. The FDA's action demonstrates the FDA's strong safety surveillance systems, Marks said, adding that the agency is committed to making scientific and data-driven decisions. ""We’ve been closely monitoring the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and occurrence of TTS following its administration and have used updated information from our safety surveillance systems to revise the EUA. The agency will continue to monitor the safety of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and all other vaccines, and as has been the case throughout the pandemic, will thoroughly evaluate new safety information,"" Marks said. To date, nearly 17 million Americans have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists said that if you have already received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, there is no need to be concerned, as the risk of blood clots happens in the days and weeks after you have received your shot. However, if Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients are at all concerned, health experts said people should reach out to their doctor with any questions. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was first authorized for emergency use by the FDA in February 2021. Just two months later, the FDA and the CDC, announced a recommended pause in the administration of the vaccine to investigate a handful of cases of TTS that had been discovered in patients across the country. The pause was lifted just 10 days later. However, in December, after reviewing additional safety and efficacy data, the CDC’s vaccine advisory recommended that people use the mRNA vaccines from vaccine companies Pfizer and Moderna, instead of Johnson & Johnson, in most situations. Through March 18, the FDA and CDC have identified 60 confirmed cases of TTS, including nine fatal cases, which illustrates that blood clots are a rare but real adverse event associated with the Johnson & Johnson shot. The factors that put an individual at risk for TTS following administration of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine remain unknown, officials said. ABC News' Sony Salzman contributed to this report.",3
"Ukrainian fighters battling Russian forces in the tunnels beneath Mariupol’s immense steel plant are refusing to surrender in the face of relentless attacks LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian fighters battling Russian forces in the tunnels beneath Mariupol’s immense steel plant refused to surrender in the face of relentless attacks, with the wife of one commander saying they had vowed to “stand till the end.” The fight in the last Ukrainian stronghold of the strategic port city reduced to ruins by the Russian onslaught appeared increasingly desperate amid growing speculation that President Vladimir Putin wants to present the Russian people with a battlefield triumph — or announce an escalation of the war — in time for Victory Day on Monday. “They won’t surrender,” Kateryna Prokopenko said Thursday after speaking by phone to her husband, a leader of the steel plant defenders. “They only hope for a miracle.” She said her husband, Azov Regiment commander Denys Prokopenko, told her he would love her forever. “I am going mad from this. It seemed like words of goodbye,” she said. The Ukrainian military's General Staff said Friday that ""the blockade of units of the defense forces in the Azovstal area continues” and that the Russians, with aviation support, had resumed assault operations to take control of the sprawling plant. Monday's Victory Day is the biggest patriotic holiday on the Russian calendar, marking the Soviet Union’s triumph over Nazi Germany. But as long as Ukrainians resist the takeover of the plant, “Russian losses will continue to build and frustrate their operational plans in southern Donbas,” the British Defense Ministry said in an assessment. Some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters, by Russia’s most recent estimate, were holed up in a maze of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal steelworks. A few hundred civilians were also believed trapped there. “There are many wounded (fighters), but they are not surrendering,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “They are holding their positions.” “Just imagine this hell! And there are children there,” he said. “More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death.” The Russians managed to get inside the plant Wednesday with the help of an electrician who knew the layout, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Internal Affairs Ministry. “He showed them the underground tunnels which are leading to the factory,” Gerashchenko said in a video. Zelenskyy said the attack was preventing evacuation of the remaining civilians, even as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said another attempt was underway. ""We must continue to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes,” Guterres said. The Kremlin denied its troops were storming the plant and has demanded the Ukrainians surrender. They have refused. Russia has also accused the fighters of preventing the civilians from leaving. The fall of Mariupol would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that the Kremlin says is now its chief objective. Capt. Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, pleaded on Ukrainian TV for the evacuation of civilians and wounded fighters from the steelworks, saying soldiers were “dying in agony due to the lack of proper treatment.” More than 100 civilians were rescued from the steelworks over the weekend. But many previous attempts to open safe corridors from Mariupol have fallen through, with Ukraine blaming shelling and firing by the Russians. Meanwhile, 10 weeks into the devastating war, Ukraine’s military claimed it recaptured some areas in the south and repelled other attacks in the east, further frustrating Putin’s ambitions after his abortive attempt to seize Kyiv. Ukrainian and Russian forces are fighting village by village. The General Staff in Kyiv said Russian forces were conducting surveillance flights, and in the hard-hit areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukrainian forces repulsed 11 attacks and destroyed tanks and armored vehicles. Russia gave no immediate acknowledgement of those losses. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Russian forces are making only “plodding” progress in the Donbas. There are growing suggestions that Ukraine might try to widen its push to seize more territory from Russia outside of Kharkiv, its second-largest city. Ukrainian chief of defense, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Thursday that a counteroffensive could begin to push Russian forces away from Kharkiv and Izyum, which has been a key node in Russia’s control of the eastern cauldron. Ukraine in recent days has driven Russian troops some 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Kharkiv, which has been repeatedly struck by Russian shelling. Additional Ukrainian advances may spare the city from artillery strikes, as well as force Moscow to divert troops from other areas of the front line. On Thursday, an American official said the U.S. shared intelligence with Ukraine about the location of a Russian flagship before the mid-April strike that sank it, one of Moscow's highest-profile failures in the war. The U.S. has provided “a range of intelligence” that includes locations of warships, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the decision to target the missile cruiser Moskva was purely a Ukrainian decision. Fearful of new attacks surrounding Victory Day, the mayor of the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk urged residents to leave for the countryside over the long weekend and warned them not to gather in public places. And the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, a key transit point for evacuees from Mariupol, announced a curfew from Sunday evening through Tuesday morning.

"Up to 30% of people could get infected, a senior administration official said. How coronavirus mutates The White House is bracing for a challenging COVID-19 surge this fall and winter that could infect up to 30% of Americans if the government can’t secure the funding for new, more targeted vaccines and ample amounts of therapeutic treatment, a senior administration official said. The official estimated as many as 100 million Americans could become infected with coronavirus over the course of three or four months during the fall and winter. The prediction would amount to about 30-40 million fewer infections than the omicron surge was and is expected to stretch out over a longer time period, the official said, but is still a significant warning. If funding for vaccines and therapeutics is secured, though, the official predicted there would be a far better chance of blunting the expected surge and keeping deaths and hospitalizations down. Most experts agree that the fall and winter will bring a surge of cases, but dismiss predictions that portend to know the severity or specificity this far out. “I think it's difficult, if not impossible, to predict the future of this virus,” said David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The prediction, based on a combination of modeling from outside experts, is just one of many potential scenarios, the official cautioned. It's very early to predict the fall or winter with such specific certainty and throughout the pandemic, attempts to do so have frequently missed the mark. The estimation also doesn’t account for the possibility that a new variant will change the country’s trajectory — a scenario that can’t be ruled out given how quickly the virus has mutated in just the last few weeks. It comes as the White House is negotiating funding on Capitol Hill, attempting to secure $22.5 billion from Congress in COVID relief but running into stalemates with Republicans. The starkly specific prediction was likely yet another push for Congress to move forward on those efforts, or risk a harsh fall and winter. A wave this fall is “absolutely” possible, but it’s also possible that the current level of infection circulating gives enough immunity to protect against overwhelming numbers of hospitalizations or death, Dowdy said. “All to say, I don't think we should be sounding alarm bells about inevitable future waves. But neither should we be declaring this pandemic over,” Dowdy said. Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said he thinks there's “very firm ground to say that we’ll experience a surge."" But the big question: ""What does that translate into?” he said. “And I think that is unknown because it's really dependent on what is circulating and what immunity we have in the population that creates that protection,” Brownstein said. He noted that the country has seen a surge every three to six months since the pandemic began — but that predicting the exact parameters of those surges has been next to impossible. Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, was similarly hesitant about the specifics, calling the prediction of 100 million infections “unknowable” but “plausible.” “We’ve learned we’re not very good at making projections,” he cautioned. Still, he expects an increase of infections this fall and winter, and didn't put much stock in immunity from the omicron wave, which infected nearly 40% of the population, protecting against a new surge. “The immunity that an unvaccinated or partially vaccinated person had from an omicron infection in January will largely be irrelevant in the face of a threat next December,” Wachter said, citing reinfections that are already occurring about three months out. The question, Wachter said, is more about decoupling — whether cases can spread without leading to a tragic number of hospitalizations or deaths, and disruption to school or work. One way to protect against that is through vaccines, like the vaccines the FDA is preparing to review in June that could protect against newer variants, or therapeutics like Paxlovid, which reduces the risk of death by 90%. The government doesn't have the funding to purchase those vaccines for this fall and expects to run out of Paxlovid around October. ""Funding from Congress will markedly increase the likelihood that we don't get creamed,"" Wachter said. ""It could make the difference between really terrible and just bad."" In negotiations on the Hill, a senior administration official said the potential for 100 million infections, affecting nearly one in three Americans, has been conveyed to Republicans. The message from the White House is that waves will keep coming, but the goal is to be able to weather them with vaccines and treatments that take away much of the risk for death. The official said those conversations have been a battle, but the White House remains optimistic. ABC News' Arielle Mitropoulos contributed to this report.",6
"This year's event carries extra significance, experts on Russia say.  What you need to know about the Russia-Ukraine conflict LONDON -- On May 9, Russia will celebrate Victory Day, its huge national holiday commemorating the anniversary of the defeat of the Nazis during World War II with a military parade through the streets of Moscow. Reports suggest that, in terms of firepower, it will be a less extravagant display, with fewer tanks and other military hardware set to take part, but this year's event carries extra significance. ""The original significance of V Day was the same for the USSR as for the other allies,"" Catriona Kelly, a professor of Russian and Soviet Culture at Trinity College, Cambridge, told ABC News. ""In the 1990s, on the other hand, commemoration became much less important, and was revived again, on an unprecedented scale, in the Putin era."" Under Putin, Victory Day has become Russia's central national holiday and veneration of the Soviet victory a cornerstone of his regime. Putin revived the military parades marking the holiday, and they have grown in size almost each year since 2014, becoming a showcase of Russian military might. War commemoration serves as a ""basis of an aggressive patriotism based on the perception of an external threat to the country's survival,"" Kelly said. An estimated 27 million people from the Soviet Union died during the Second World War, an enormous death toll that dwarfs that of other countries, and memory of the war still holds deep personal significance for many Russians. Putin's avowed goal to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine is directly linked to the Kremlin's efforts to cultivate that history for its political ends, according to Mark Galeotti, a security expert on Russian affairs. ""Largely the whole point was exactly to try and wrap this war in the mantle of what they call the Great Patriotic War,"" Galeotti said. ""Remember, Putin expected this to be a quick and easy victory in two weeks. I think this was going to be his kind of claim to historical fame. You know, this is going to be his moment, he wanted it to be comparable to victory over Nazis."" Ukraine and Western countries, as well as independent experts, believe the Kremlin had hoped to set Victory Day as a deadline to achieve a military victory in the war with Ukraine or at least to declare the conquest of the Donbas region. But the disastrous course of the war so far for Russia -- that has seen it retreat from Kyiv and its current offensive on east Ukraine now stalled -- has forced the Kremlin to approach the day differently. The British armed forces minister recently said that Russia will ""probably"" use Victory Day as an opportunity to formally declare war on Ukraine, but the Kremlin has denied this. ""That would be a great irony if Moscow used the occasion of Victory Day to declare war, which in itself would allow them to surge conscripts in a way they're not able to do now,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters recently. ""In a way, that would be tantamount to revealing to the world that their war effort is failing, that they are floundering in their military campaign and military objectives."" During the past ten weeks of war, many analysts have pointed to May 9 as a key marker, a date where Putin will have to show the Russian people a ""prize"" from the war, which is only referred to in the country as a ""special military operation."" That ""prize"" could be Mariupol, the beleaguered port city that has been the site of some of the worst fighting and bombing since the war began, though there is no hiding that the war has not gone to plan. ""Any Russian victory that can be proclaimed at this stage will look like an approximation at best, though the onslaught on Azovstal in Mariupol in recent days suggests that complete capture of the city will be represented as a prize"" on May 9, Kelly said. Ukraine's military has claimed that the streets of the city, where tens of thousands are feared to have been killed under the Russian assault, are being cleared of debris in preparation for a parade there on Victory Day. Russian intelligence assessments initially said that the capital of Kyiv would fall within a matter of days of the invasion, but stiff Ukrainian resistance and a united front in the West have now changed the kind of Victory Day the Kremlin will be commemorating. Even so, Putin retains a tight control of the narrative around the war, and so far, the impact that could reverberate at home when news of the thousands of Russians killed emerges, has not been felt. ""I'm sure Putin would have loved to have had the victory to announce for Victory Day,"" Galeotti told ABC News. ""But ... when you have all the state media under your control and you've squeezed out every element of independent media, in some ways you get to write the narrative, and then the narrative will be that Mariupol is won, that this was never about taking all of Ukraine."" From the information available, public opinion seems to be narrowly in favor of the war in Russia, though Galeotti said the image projected of the ""special operation"" in the Russian media has ""nothing at all to do with the reality of what's happened."" Whatever Putin says in his speech on Victory Day, there has been no suggestion that Russia will be winding down its war anytime soon, even if their war aims have now changed to create a land corridor to Crimea. ""Putin has to 'win', or to put it differently, he has no reverse gear,"" Kelly said. ""That means his only means of reacting to a miscalculation is to fight back. All the evidence suggests that he expected a rapid collapse of the Ukrainian armed forces of the kind that happened in Crimea in 2014. And he didn't expect pushback from Western countries on the level there has been. Ukraine has been a shock from both points of view and is the biggest challenge of his political career.""",6
"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, and will isolate and work remotely this week COVID cases and hospitalizations surge in Northeast NEW YORK -- New York Gov. Kathy Hochul tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, saying she will isolate and work remotely this week. “Thankfully, I'm vaccinated and boosted, and I'm asymptomatic,” Hochul, 63, tweeted. “A reminder to all New Yorkers: get vaccinated and boosted, get tested, and stay home if you don’t feel well.” A day earlier, the Democratic governor had tweeted a photo from the Olana State Historic Site outside Hudson, New York, which she visited to thank park volunteers. Hochul is at least the 18th U.S. governor to test positive for COVID-19, according to an Associated Press tally. Several U.S. governors have tested positive in recent months, with Connecticut's Ned Lamont and Maine's Janet Mills testing positive in April. New York City Mayor Eric Adams tested positive on April 10, his 100th day in office. Hochul’s positive test comes amid rising case numbers in New York.

"Pale and drawn, the last civilians sheltering in the bunkers beneath the sprawling steel mill in the decimated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol arrived late Sunday night in Zaporizhzhia, the first major Ukrainian city beyond the frontline Battle continues for Ukrainian steel plant ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine -- Pale and drawn, the last civilians sheltering in bunkers beneath a sprawling steel mill in the decimated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol arrived late Sunday night in Zaporizhzhia, the first major Ukrainian city beyond the frontlines. The shattered survivors spoke of constant shelling, dwindling food, ubiquitous mold — and using hand sanitizer for cooking fuel. Ten buses slowly pulled into Zaporizhzhia’s deserted streets under darkness, carrying 174 evacuees from the Mariupol area. They included 31 of the 51 civilians evacuated in the last day from the Azovstal steel mill, where an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are making what appears to be their last stand. Both Ukrainian and Russian officials have said these civilians are the last non-combatants from the industrial complex. “It was terrible in the bunkers,"" said 69-year-old Lyubov Andropova, who had been in Azovstal since March 10. ""Water would run down from the ceilings. There was mold everywhere. We were worried for the children, for their lungs.” The shelling was constant, and there was fear “that our bunker would collapse,” she said. “Everything shook, we didn’t go out.” The seaside steel mill is the only part of Mariupol not under Russian control. Thanks to its warren of tunnels and bunkers deep underground, many civilians had chosen it as the safest place to take cover from the relentless shelling of the formerly thriving port city that has now been largely destroyed. Just a few days after the war began on Feb. 24, Dmytro Sviydakov took shelter in the bunkers with his wife and 12-year-old daughter. They entered Azovstal on Feb. 27. It would be more than two months before they could leave. Huddled in a bunker with around 50 to 60 people, the first month and a half was bearable, he said, but then the shelling intensified. A food storage area was blown up, and he and others resorted to scavenging, including searching through workers’ lockers. Fuel for cooking was scarce too, but then they discovered that hand sanitizer — well-stocked because of the coronavirus pandemic — was a good substitute. “What can’t you do when you have nothing!” he said, as he waited for a bus that would carry Azovstal evacuees to temporary accommodations in Zaporizhzhia. Yehor Chekhonatskyi, a steel mill employee sheltering in the bunker with his two sons, wife and their dog, said that when food ran low, soldiers defending Azovstal helped. “We wouldn’t have made it otherwise,” he said. “I don’t know how long we could have survived, but for sure we wouldn’t have survived until today.” In the last few days, they had just pasta, water and some spices left - enough for soup once a day. His family entered the mill on March 1 for safety, he said, after he narrowly escaped being shelled while walking his dog. Despite the widespread destruction of Mariupol, 18 of the 51 people evacuated from Azovstal chose to remain in the city, said United Nations officials, who were involved in securing safe passage for the evacuees. Another two — a man and a woman — were detained by Russian forces. The woman, who was held on suspicion of being a military medic, had been traveling with her 4-year-old daughter. The mother and child were separated, and the little girl made it to Zaporizhzhia with the rest of the evacuees, U.N. officials said. But several hundred more who wanted to join the evacuation convoy from other areas held by Russian forces had to stay behind after Russia and Ukraine failed to reach an agreement on their evacuation. “It was quite heartbreaking to see them waiting and not being able to join us,” said United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Osnat Lubrani. “Overall within a period of 10 days we’ve been able to bring a total of 600 people in very complex, high-risk, very sensitive safe passage operations,” Lubrani said, adding that the U.N. hoped to be able to bring more civilians out in the future.",9
"""You are fighting for the motherland,"" the Russian leader told his troops. Putin's Victory Day show of force LONDON -- During a military parade in Moscow on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed his troops fighting in neighboring Ukraine, but offered little insight into his next steps. ""You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of the Second World War,"" Putin said in a patriotic speech for Victory Day, a national holiday in Russia commemorating the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Columns of Russian soldiers marched through Moscow's Red Square, alongside tanks and other military vehicles boasting huge intercontinental ballistic missiles. ""Now here, on the Red Square, soldiers and officers from many regions of our vast homeland stand shoulder to shoulder, including those who came directly from Donbas, directly from the combat zone,"" Putin said. Putin launched a ""special military operation"" into Ukraine on Feb. 24, with Russian forces invading from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east. They quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, but ultimately failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and other major cities in the north. Russian forces were met with strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, despite weeks of relentless bombardment that decimated entire neighborhoods and claimed civilian lives. The Russian military announced on March 29 it would scale down activities in the north around Kyiv and Chernihiv and instead focus its efforts on the ""liberation"" of the disputed Donbas region in the east, which is home to a mostly Russian-speaking population. Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Donbas since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. On April 18, the Russian military began a full-scale ground offensive in Donbas in an attempt to capture the strategic port city of Mariupol and to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea. Although he showed no signs of backing down, Putin on Monday did not make any declarations of war, peace or victory during his remarks at the Victory Day parade. He drew parallels between Soviet soldiers battling Nazi troops and the Russian forces fighting now in Ukraine, as he has vowed to ""de-Nazify"" the former Soviet republic. He also spoke of Donbas as if it was already part of Russia. ""These days, you are fighting for our people in the Donbas. For the security of our homeland, Russia,"" he said. ""You are defending what fathers and grandfathers, great-grandfathers fought for."" Putin accused Ukraine of seeking to attain nuclear weapons and planning a ""punitive operation in the Donbas, for an invasion of our historical lands, including Crimea."" He also laid blame on the West for refusing to have ""an honest dialogue"" about Russia's demands for formal guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will pull back its forces from countries in eastern Europe that joined after the Cold War. ""Thus, an absolutely unacceptable threat was systematically created for us and directly at our borders,"" Putin added. ""The danger was growing everyday."" The Russian leader claimed that attacking Ukraine ""was a forced, timely and only right decision -- the decision of a sovereign, strong, independent country."" ""Russia has given a preemptive rebuff to aggression,"" he said. Just hours before Putin's remarks, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy released a video message marking the 1945 victory over the Nazis, telling his country that ""very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine."" ""Today, we celebrate the Day of Victory over Nazism. And we will not give anyone a single piece of our history,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We are proud of our ancestors who, together with other nations in the anti-Hitler coalition, defeated Nazism. And we will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated."" ""On the Day of Victory over Nazism, we are fighting for a new victory,"" he added. ""The road to it is difficult, but we have no doubt that we will win.""",6
